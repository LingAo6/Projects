The reception is clear as a bell.The speakerphone is great on both the handset and the base, half the time people do not even know that I have them on speaker.Some of the people we talk to often are very hard to hear and they come through loud and clear even in the lowest of the volume settings.The color display lacks luster, but a phone is for talking on not looking at.  The nice thing is that you can put a picture of the person with their name and number so that when they call it comes up on the screen.  I like this for cell phones especially because they usually just say cellular call on the ID.The answering machine is perfect.  It never records hangups including callers that wait till the end of the greeting and then decide to hang up.  It too is loud and clear making it easy to hear the messages whether at home or away.  Another thing it does that is nice is when you have it set to screen calls it does not play your greeting out loud.  It goes quite until the person begins to record their message.  The date and time stamp comes after the message so that you do not even have to listen to it if you do not want to.There are plenty of ringer options that range from ear busting to soft and barely audible.The buttons are sturdy and glow when it rings or you press them so they are easy to read in dim lighting.When you clear the caller ID from one handset it deletes them from all handsets.And the phonebooks can be both private to that handset and shared among all handsets.The talking caller ID is more amusing than anything else as it has a hard time with pronunciation, but it does make it somewhat possible to not have to run and look at the phone to see who is calling, nice if you are busy and cannot get to where you can see the phone.  Since it only announces twice per call it keeps from being annoying.This is a great phone and I have recommended it to many people I know who are looking for a good cordless.",5,Panasonic KX-TG5776S ROCKS!,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",395,11,11,1,helpful

165192,A3CEX136DRB8JK,B0007O97Y4,"Jim ""SpringBrookRanch""","[39, 39]","I purchased the HP9800d with two tasks in mind: to do production printing of sales materials and to print digital photos in high resolution, large format. I am disappointed to conclude that the 9800 will do neither. In short this printer will not come close to doing what it is advertised to do. I have been the full distance with HP customer support and they also agree that it will not perform yet they did not respond to my request for a refund. I have spent enough time, money and wasted paper to have bought three of these things, or better yet one good printer. This does not include the cost of sales materials mailed late and of poor quality.Lets start with printing photographs. The printer is advertised to print at a simulated 4800dpi at up to 13x19 inches borderless. One would assume (foolishly) that the printer will do both at the same time. I am a graphics professional using industry standard software, Photoshop CS2 and QuarkExpress 6.5, my computer is an Intel based graphics workstation running XP pro. Sometimes I can get the printer to print an 8x10 at maximum resolution; I have never gotten it to print larger unless I drop the resolution down to best. HP support responded that best and maximum are almost the same so don't worry about it. If you want to print borderless in Quark, HP support will instruct you to use the old 9600 printer driver and set it to the default printer for that printing job. What a bogus solution when working in a networked environment, no one knows which driver is currently set and the printer tends to get confused along with us. If I send it an 8.5x11 from Quark with 4 full frame images it will only print 3 of them, leaving a hole in the layout. Thus we are forced to design our layouts around what the printer likes not our customers.Now let's look at production printing. The 9800 is rated by HP to print 5,000 pages a month. That is 10 reams of paper. One would assume that at this rate the 9800 could do small production runs of specialty sales materials, which is one of HPs advertising points. We have been trying to print a 20 page catalog using two sided printing. We are using HP bright white paper. Paper handling is very poor. Many times it will refuse to pick up paper from the tray, we have found that if you only put 50 or so sheets of paper in the tray it works a little better but is still unreliable. We will set a print job and come back to find that only 2 or three sheets out of 100 have printed, repeat this a dozen times and the schedule is now shot. The 9800 has a nasty habit of pulling several sheets at once from the tray resulting in blank pages in the document and blowing two sided print order. This means that we have to go through every catalog, by hand, and look at every page to make sure they are there and correct and then go back and print the pages that are missing. Do that 100 times and now check your schedule again. To top all this off, paper outfeed is unreliable also. Printed sheets being ejected from the printer will catch sheets already in the out tray pushing them off onto the floor in a big pile. Great way to get the day started to come in in the morning and find 100 sheets of catalog in a big pile on the floor, completely mixed up and out of order, and don't forget some pages are missing and there are blank pages in there also. Now where did that sales schedule go?If you connect the printer via USB and load the toolbox software you are in for a computer crash. The software attempts to establish bi-directional communications with the printer and cannot. It will continue to load copies of the toolbox and continually ping for the printer until it uses 100% of cpu time and grinds the machine to a halt. How many poor consumers are out there wondering why their computer hates them when they just bought it a new printer?In summary, the 9800 might serve a snapshot photographer where demand and expectations are low. It is no where near satisfying a professional graphics artist. The 9800 might serve a very small office that does occasional printed mailings of low resolution and they have the time to baby sit the printer and double check it's output. The 9800 is definitely not the printer that HP would lead you to believe and I would not recommend for demanding professionals. The 9800 is a consumer printer, at best, that is posing as a professional machine. I have worn out piles of HP printers over the years and have been a very loyal customer. When it comes to the 9800 I feel that I was grossly mislead by HP and then left to hang when they could (would) not address the issues. Any equity or good will that HP had built with me over the years (and there was a lot) they cashed in when they sold me this printer. Rather than just going out and buying HP I will shop the field.",2,poor consumer grade printer posing as a professional machine,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",893,39,39,1,helpful

I had to replace the phone because it interfered with our wireless network, and I figured I'd get a new answering machine at the same time - 7 years later, the technology must be better, I reasoned.Not so. The sound quality on this phone OK, but worse than on my old phone. And the sound quality of the answering machine is unacceptaby muffled. But those are the first of several big disappointments. The phone has nearly no sidetone, meaning you don't hear yourself speaking in the earpiece. This makes every call uncomfortable. When the phone is on the base station ringing and you pick it up, it doesn't get ""picked up"" - you have to press a button. Likewise, hanging it up doesn't hang it up. When you press the button to talk, there's a 1-second delay before the caller can hear you, so you end up saying hello twice. Oh, let's see. The ""wallpaper"" backgrounds are insanely amateurish. No matter how badly you draw, you draw better than the Michelangelos who made this thing. Next: some features are configured on the screen on the base station, while some are configured with an audio interface. The distinction is random. The icons on the phone are highlighted with a movable square outline - except that some of them ARE squares, so the highlight disappears. My outgoing message is unintelligible - I had to yell into the thing, and you can still barely hear me.This phone would be a bargain at $10, a reasonable deal at $20, a ripoff at $30. I paid $110.

327077,A2KI0LAYW1AM7R,B000V2RU0A,Machina,"[24, 26]","I deleted the review of when I first received the printer in which I gave it 4 stars. Since then, I was able to install and configure Canon's previous flagship, the MX850. This couple with the extra time I've spent with my MX310 was enough for me to lower it by one star, and tell you why.I got this printer because I needed a fax machine. I tried to consider all Canon multi-functions, but their website is no help. Their Product Comparison feature is as useful to deciding which product is right for you as looking at detailed pictures of printers and their prices. Actually, that would be more useful. Judging by the information featured on the site, I figured that I didn't need the more expensive printers because I wouldn't use their extra features.I'm happy with the print quality; happy that it doesn't jam like my old HP used to; happy that I can finally fax those pesky fax requesting insurance companies. The scan quality seems a bit lacking, but I've never used a scanner before so I can't be sure.Here's one of my main issues with the product. Setting up the fax machine was not an easy experience. The screen on the Multifunction used to configure the fax machine isn't very intuitive. After using the MX850, trust me on this -- get a multifunction with a color LCD screen. The booklet wasn't the easiest to understand and the instructions were all over the place; I even had to visit a PDF Manual in the computer to properly set it up.My other major complaint is on the software. Why do I need four different scanning programs? That's not nice. If I was someone who didn't know much about computers, I would get confused and frustrated about which one I should use. I don't like that they put such little thought into the consumer.Another thing about the software is how it installs in the itself in the start menu. Why can't it just create a single folder and put all the things that have to do with the printer in there?  It doesn't do that; it installs, even the manual, in a different folder in the start menu. It was nice of Canon to add clutter to my start menu.These issues were very annoying when I first got it, but once everything was sorted out, I was happy overall. That is until I used the LCD screen on the MX850. It's now painful to use my small primitive monochrome screen when I think of what I could be using instead.Wait, the review isn't over yet. There is one issue that I noticed on MX310 and the MX850 - difficulty in receiving faxes. These printers have a hard time distinguishing a voice call from a fax call. Even on Telephone Priority, they answer voice calls with the fax and then hang up on the person when it notices no fax info. When receiving a fax, they mistake it for a voice call. I'm still trying to figure this out. It will probably result in a call to Canon.Update 9/20/08:Sometime in August, I started to notice lines in my prints. I tried cleaning multiple times and even a deep cleaning cycle, but nothing happened. While its distracting, I can still read my documents fine.Update 12/4/08:After putting in a new black ink cartridge, the lines went away.",3,OK multifunction.

The sales associates at Circuit City were so astonished, they asked if I could leave the two sets to demonstrate the differences in the two printers.  The scroll through the SD card on the first go round is very slow and requires patience.  After you scroll through all of them once, it does go faster.  For those who are wondering, I did verify the settings of the printer was at the Photo level and not a lower quality.  If you are only concerned about price and not the photo, this may be a choice to consider.  Although, I still advise saving up for a better printer.

I was getting some line errors, went to Vonage's help, reset the default fax speed as directed and it seems fine.I'm happy with this device so far and would buy it again. Having said that, things I would change ;-)1) The computer interface is fairly primitive. It works fine, just not what I've come to expect. One neat function-it'll scan directly into a .pdf file. That has proven useful.2) It's fairly noisy when printing. There are 3 noise levels,none of whic are really objectionable, but noticeable. The loudest level is only when it's actually printing.3) The machine control panel display is fairly primitive. Small and narrow viewing angle.4) It would be nice if the various fax settings e.g. resolution, retry interval etc. were settable via PC rather than numbered menus on (did I mention) a fairly primitive screen5) The single sheet/envelope feed could use some sort of paper support.

We purchased this as a service unit that we could toss in the van and take with us on service calls.  It is small and light.  And pretty rugged.  Plus it is easy to use as a printer and copier.  Just plain handy to have around.  Anyway, we ended up getting one for our youngest daughter when she went off to college.  I figured that a small lightweight multi-function would coume in handy.  Needless to say, she loves it.This printer is about as easy to set up as it gets.  Unpack it, plug it in, pop in the cartridges, and turn it on.  Run the setup CD on your Mac or PC.  That is it.Print quality for text is pretty good.  Certainly good enough for everyday use.  And it is pretty fast.  On a good quality paper the characters are very sharp, but on cheapo thin paper characters can be a little fuzzy at the edges.  Still readable, just not as crisp as on good paper.  Stick to good paper for printing text.  I actually tried several papers from HP and Great White and the best text results came with from HP 24lb premium inkjet paper.  But I settled on HP 22 lb multiuse paper because it is just a whole lot cheaper and still works very well.The scanner is great.  A little slower than more pricey models, but will scan just about anything.  Scan colors and resolution are very very good.  And the flatbed design means you can scan from books.  Very handy for the student.  Scanned photos and graphics are very sharp and the colors are accurate.As a copier it is good for just doing a few pages at a time.  It is slower than a dedicated copier, but if all you need is to copy a few pages, it works great.  The copy quality is actually better than on most dedicated copiers.  Just not as fast.  We even copied some photos and those came out almost identical to the originals.Photo printing is where this really shines.  Great quality photo printing.  As good as any I have seen, even off printers costing 3 times as much.  Great photo printer.  Really surprising for a $100 all-in-one.Other nice features include no need to align the print head after changing cartridges, so no ink wasted on alingment sheets.  Also, ink prices are fairly low.  For the same number of pages, the price of ink for the Epson is about half of what it costs for my HP.  Best of all is  a built in card reader, so you can insert your camera card and print right to the printer.  You can also copy images from your card to your PC from the printer.  Comes in handy.So for your $100, you get a decent printer, a great scanner, a good coper, and a wonderful photo printer.  Plus a card reader!

Secondly, I used is with a CISS (continuous ink supply system) which you can easily find on eBay. And third, I used it with refillable cartridges, again which can easily be found in many places on the web. Some simply truths about Epson or printers in general. Leave the power on, do not shut them off, because if you do they are constantly cleaning the print heads (wasted ink big time). The Epson print heads are separate and are cleaned easily if you do a web search and learn how to clean them. Next, because you leave the printer on, you must print at least one page every other day to keep the print head from drying, and yes you can do it automatically if you get the right software.  The best choice after using a CISS for 4 years on the printer is the refillable cartridges, because when they get down to about 70 per cent empty you can fill them up while still in the printer. Ink cost per fill up is pennies, but you must do your homework and purchase good ink (Durabrite or similar). The Japanese also have some very good Epson quality inks. I also tore this printer apart, re-routed the waste-ink tube to the outside of the printer and let it empty into a empty plastic squeeze bottle. I also at the same time removed the over saturated ink blotter pads on the inside bottom of the printer, and used the Epson Utility to reset the ink counter to zero. The printer will have both paper and ink lights flashing alternately which is their error indicator for maximum ink saturation of the internal ink pads which Epson sets at about 47,000 pages of print. Once this is done, you have a new printer good for another 5 year of good to heavy use. With the external waste ink bottle on the outside of the printer you will really appreciate how must ink these or any printers with the exception of the Kodak use, and if you were using Epson inks, just how much that lovely printer is really costing you.

124391,AHBUDOLKOWTH9,B0002AAQIY,Will Bueche,"[29, 29]","This is the VW Beetle of the scanning world -- tiny and toylike, but excellent. While archiving an extremely large amount of papers of various conditions and sizes, I was pleasantly surprised to find this scanner scans all the way to each sheet's edge -- essential when scanning materials with notes written in the margins. Easily handles smaller sized papers (but items of oversized width cannot fit into the 8.5 inch wide feeder). I was also impressed that the blank page detection sensibly ignores staple holes or other binding marks on otherwise blank pages. Automatic color detection is sometimes fooled by aged paper or coffee stains into scanning in color -- but then again coffee is a color after all. The paper path is very direct (slides from top to bottom) so if paper ever jams (as it will if you try to put cardstock through it without bending it first) it is easy to pop open and remove the sheets. Includes Adobe Acrobat.An update to my review: I still love it, but, I have three criticisms:It is best when set for ""black and white"" only, and bear in mind that the black and white images it captures are high contrast. If you want to capture shades of grey you'll still want a flatbed scanner. So I've been doing the bulk of my scanning with this Fujitsu, and I set aside items that need more careful flatbed work. It has been a real time saver.Secondly, the color accuracy of this scanner is exceptionally poor - sufficient for capturing a bright red ""VOID"" mark stamped on a form, for example, but not suited for anything requiring nuanced colors.Thirdly, the software's optional ""deskew"" function, which is sometimes useful for leveling out any badly typed pages, only works on pages that are completely full of type. Indeed, any page with wide open spaces, such as a title page or a page with only a single paragraph of type, will end up worse if the option is on. A perfectly typed (but brief) page will end up up to 5 degrees off kilter if the ""deskew"" option is on. This is obviously a software limitation which they should fix.In review, this is a great high contrast black and white scanner that will dramatically reduce your need for a traditional flatbed scanner - but it won't replace it entirely.",5,"Tiny and toylike, but excellent",1111622400,"03 24, 2005",394,29,29,1,helpful
285603,A2DP1QSM81YIR5,B000NNKA40,Stephen Holland,"[73, 75]","This review is in the context of a Mac System. I replace an aging Epson Stylus Color ink-jet printer with this purchase.  I was tired of replacing a a three color ink cartridge, and picked the Canon iP3300 in part on the separate ink cartridge approach that this printer uses.We use this as the main general purpose printer for our home computer.  I am very pleased with the results.  Image quality is excellent.  The print looks laser printer quality in sharpness.  Color rendition is excellent.  The printing is fast.  There are two paper paths that can be set up with different papers, making printing from different media easy and automatic.  The printer is quiet except for some extra noise when it rapidly loads or quickly spits out paper after completing printing.  Even then it is typical for an ink-jet printer.  If the rapid load noise is objectionable the printer can be set to load quietly.The drivers are just great.  If you open to cover while printing it stops and an alert comes up and gently reminds you to close the top when done. The printer utility runs very well.  It gives the options of automatic turn-on and turn-off, head cleaning (including standard, deep cleaning, and bottom plate cleaning), nozzle check test prints, and print head alignment.  It also includes an option for quiet mode.  In this mode the paper is fed more slowly and quietly than in regular mode, which really is quieter than the standard mode.  It even gives the option of setting times of day when quiet mode is in force, a nice touch.  The auto turn-on and turn-off is disabled by default, so if you get this printer be sure to set it up in the printer utility.  Drive loading required using the included CD.  The installer ran smoothly and the disk space requirement is modest.  I am running 10.4.9 at this moment, and it works well.  The only thing I haven't tried is the PictBridge port in the front since I don't have a digital camera.  Images I tested were the background images available in /Library/Desktop Pictures.An interesting observation is that the lp utility work with this printer, but when a pdf file is printed out the text is lighter and less sharp then when the same PDF is printed by Preview.  Preview also prints a PDF faster. For straight ASCII both lp and TextEdit are equally fast, but lp lost half a line at the bottom edge of a page.  I do some programmatic printing using the command line utilities.  Perhaps there is a driver for lp that I'm missing.You don't get automatic duplexing like theCanon PIXMA iP4300 Photo Printer (1438B002), but the iP4300 is $20 more and needs 5 color inks rather than the 3 color inks that to iP3300 uses.  I expect cheaper ink costs on the iP3300.  If photos are a big issue for you, research the 3 color vs 5 color issue.Anyway, great printer for a great price.  5 stars for the great quality output despite this printer being less than $100.

I cleaned and oiled the blades regularly. Finally, the shredder just stopped working. So, I took the machine apart to find the reason.First, I found that the shredding blades fit into individual slots and that the backs of theses slots were closed. No place for any paper residue that gets into there to get out. The backs of the slots were packed ""solid"" with small pieces of paper. Consequently, any time one more piece of paper was spun into the back of the slot, it was enough to cause the shredder to jam. The only way to remove all of the compacted paper from the backs of the slots is to remove the blades completely. Very poor design!Second, I found why my shredder stopped working. A  sheet metal screw had worked loose and fallen between the drive belt and one of the gears. The little rubber belt had a hole in it and therefor was no good. Since my shredder was out of warranty, asking for a replacement was not an option. So, I called Fellowes Customer Service and asked to purchase a new drive belt. I was astounded to learn that Fellowes does not stock parts. Now I am forced to throw away a  shredder that I used very little because  a $5 part is not stocked by the manufacturer.

I started with the old Siemens stuff (utter garbage) in the 1990's and really liked the panasonic multi line systems that I've used in a few locations since they released them.  Enormous frustration with the user interfaces on the Panasonic Hybrid PBX system in my office lead me to flee from Panasonic to try another vendor with this system.The low cost of the phones and the ease of registering new handsets are terrific.  My favorite feature is the programmable banner on each phone.  Once the banner is programmed in, you can use the intercom feature on any other handset to call another location by NAME, not handset number!  Really brilliant!  A great design, if only these things had the range or a way to switch like a cell system to another base location.Reception and RangeI should have trusted my instinct when reading about the 5.8 GHZ systems.  If you read carefully, you will note that they do not make a comparison to 2.4 GHZ systems EXCEPT to note that the 5.8 GHZ systems won't interfere with most 802.11x networks.  Unforutnately, when I replaced my 5 year old panasonic 2 line system with this, I noticed a significatn decrease in transmission range especially through the old stone barn walls of our house.  I suspect the higher frequency just can't penetrate the old thick walls like the 2.4 ghz systems can.Even though this system is supposedly spread spectrum and frequency hopping, if i have a bad connection and move around the house, the connection stays bad, even if i move right next to the phone.I would love to find a consumer version of the panasonic cordless system that offers multiple ""cell"" locations on an internal phone systems.  The engenius systems still seem like they aren't ready for prime time.If you buy this system, be prepared for a decrease in range versus 2.4 ghz systems.If I could find an alternative that's as well designed, I'd repalce this system quickly.",2,"Superb User Interface, Expandable, Medicore Range",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",335,41,45,0.911111111,helpful

I have been very disappointed in print quality on glossy paper, even Canon's own Photo Paper Plus Glossy.I had some cheap paper from local office supply store laying around (Staples Photo Supreme Satin). The Pro9500 does print very well on this Satin paper which is kinda a smooth matte paper.Another paper that I found printed well with the Pro9500 is Ilford Galerie Smooth Pearl Paper. (Download the ICC profile from Ilford.com) Again this is a smooth matte type paper, not glossy.Another thing you have to watch out for with the Pro9500, not all inkjet printer paper is compatible with pigmented inks.Previously I would edit my photos in Photoshop and save to .jpg and take them down to my local photo lab for printing.  I purchased this Pro9500 so I would have more control over my prints. I can't get any decent prints on glossy paper, which in my humble opinon gives the best color.  Prints onto Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy paper and other brands of glossy paper look dull and the the black ink seems to print too heavy with no detail in the dark areas and shadows. Colors are muted on glossy paper.The owners manual is on CD-rom and doesn't give any advice on how to print from Photoshop or other imaging programs. It only shows how to print from Canon's Easy Print plug in for Photoshop which is a joke.I had lots of difficulting trying to get good prints from Photoshop. Finally found a video podcast from Russell Brown that explained how to set up Photoshop to print and what controls to turn off in the print driver.

I bought one; it didn't work out the box; returned and replaced (of course with a refurbished rather than new); returned and replaced again.Each time there has been something wrong with the ink carriage or the cartridges.For those with the same problem, you too have seen those maddening blinking ink cartridges. Cartridges are full, but for whatever reason the printer can't read them.  And this problem shuts the whole printer down.  You can't even scan documents to your desktop.  Sometimes if I turn the printer on and off 3 or 4 times, or leave it on overnight and then re-set, then it will work. Most of the time it won't, and in any case I need my printer to work more often than not (rather than the other way around).Since my printer does occasionally work, I understand why those who luckily have a nondefective carriage are happy with it. It scans and prints just fine.  But even so -- it chugs ink like a man who just emerged from the Sahara. Even with occassional use I'm buying expensive cartridges all the time.  The ink-jet system is a poor choice -- too fragile and the expense of continually buying new cartridges quickly overtakes any upfront savings versus a laser.Canon have given up on its product; since mine works at least sometimes they won't do anything further.

The print speed is average printing in the highest quality print (Up to 2 min. per photo in Photo quality.)  It does print faster in Normal mode, and still, the picture is good enough quality if just being stored in an album.  The auto-enhance feature works really well.  It doesn't over saturate colors as many computer programs even do.  The enhanced photos print in a warmer / richer tone.  The red eye feature really doesn't fix your problems.  You're better off adjusting camera flash intensity and trying to prevent red eye without relying on the printer to detect and remove it.  It does fair on wide angle group shots but hardly noticeable on close-up shots.  Overall functionality is well designed.  Printer does take a while to boot up...like a computer.  Buy an extra ink kit as the one included goes really quick!Burning: Depending on your camera usage and quality, you can't just burn your 70 photos to the CD.  If using medium resolution photos, do not expect to be able to burn more than 10 - 15 photos at a time.  Copy 10 to the CD, then 10 more, then 10 more...and so on.  Tech support said it writes in only 2X speed and is intended for home use...not designed for burning high quantity / quality photos.  If planning to burn 100 photos...just use the computer.  The index page it prints is a great feature.  You can print the index of a CD and/or card.Great printer for those who don't have a computer and want burning capabilities.

39816,A371LO7RP9RCOR,B000067V0A,"A. Gilbert ""TG5003""","[106, 135]","I bought this printer only to test the ""archival"" quality paper and inks. I must admit, I was quite impressed with the Luster photo paper surface; it resembled the true photographic luster surface that I am used to, but with a tighter texture. I was also quite impressed with the level of color control sliders and methods of color matching in the printer's software. (A side note, anyone who is truly concerned with accurate color will want to invest in a colorimeter and software to properly balance their monitor from a company such as Monaco; do not waste your time fighting with color matching.)For starters, I first noticed that exterior of this printer was rather flimsy and some parts are quite breakable. The printer tray in the front simply folds down, however when folding up, it only ""clicks"" on the left side. On one of my pritners, the tray falls at the slightest bump. Additionally, the extendable paper tray is a bit cheap and can be a little cumbersome to extend. Also, the cover is easily scratched; even wiping it with a paper towel can cause abrasions in the opaque black cover. With use, over time it will loose it's cosmetic appearance quite quickly. I have always thought Epson printers were of lower contruction standards when compared to HP.As a very experienced user (with proper monitor balancing tools and tons of ""profile"" experience) I was not able to get color results that I was happy with, mainly in regards to magenta levels. I was forced to tweak the magenta settings down by -2 for every print, regardless of which profile I used. Furthermore, when compared to traditional photographic images, I have had difficulty with a push/pull between magenta and green. While on one hand a portion of any given image appeared too magenta, another portion of the same image was obviously too green, particularly anyone with blonde hair. Obviouslly, there is no way to do an overall color correction for this. Every print I have printed has this issue, and I have used two different printers. Overall, the prints just did not look right to me. When comparing the Epson 2200 prints to a PROFESSIONALLY operated Fuji Frontier system, after the Epson prints are completely dry they seemed to have a ""fog"" to them, almost like looking through a pane of thin non-glare glass.The most notable disappointment with these prints is any areas that either are white or black, or fade to white or black. The slightest angle in the light reveals a myriad of reflection patterns, which I find completely unacceptable. These reflections are highly noticeable when the prints are viewed on a wall from any angle. They can be quite ugly and destroy the image, especially images with high contrast.More recently, I took an image that I was mostly happy with and professionally framed it. We used conservation quality mats and conservation glass, which blocks 98% of the UV rays. Within two weeks, I noticed something curious and have yet to take the frame apart to investigate further. When viewing through the glass at an angle, the parts of the image that are the darkest seem to be transferring to the glass. The image is 1/8 inch away from touching the glass. While this has created an interesting pattern on the glass, obviously this is not desired and leads me to question the ""archival"" claims made by Epson. Since we are in a dry climate, it is not humidity; and since we are in a rural area, it is not an effect of ozone or pollution, both of which environmental conditions are mentioned in the paper packaging regarding proper print storage and display. The only thing I can figure is that static electricity is somehow pulling a very thin layer of the darker inks off the print towards the glass. We'll see. ......I simply cannot recommend this printer to anyone who is greatly concerned with accurate color. I have tried two different printers, and getting accurate color has been a big hassle. Don't get me wrong, the average consumer will be happy I'm sure, but anyone who desires accuracy will not be pleased, especially if they are a professional. I impolore any professional user to be just as critical of this printer, as any print they would receive from a lab; there is quite a big difference. Again, for an ink-jet ""photo"" printer, the Epson 2200 is a huge leap forward and at first glance it is quite impressive; but after closer inspection, to say the printer is of true ""photographic quality"" simply is not true.I'll stick to creating my own work, while leaving the printing to the professionals down the street. At least I know for a fact that my prints will still be around for the rest of my life, and beyond; and who needs the push/pull between green and magenta! In the long run, getting accurate color is cheaper when going to the lab, rather than wasting two or more attempts on the printer.",2,"VERY Convincing, but NOT the REAL thing.",1049846400,"04 9, 2003",839,106,135,0.785185185,helpful

I installed these in lieu of the smaller starter cartridges provided by Brother, after a few days there has been no problem. The size and ml capacity of the black ink is massive (49 ml) the color ink seems to be 29 ml, which is about 50% larger than an LC 61 cartridge which is used on my smaller Brother J615W color MFC.This offer contains a lot of black inkjet cartridges. 4 black and 2 of each color for about the price of a Brother black cartridge, these are a much better value in my opinion at this time. The price has dropped from $28 to $19 delivered over the past 4 months. This offer is best if you do a lot of black and white only printing, as if you use color often, it is likely a pile of unopened black cartridge will exist while you are running out of cyan, magenta or another color. There is another offer, with 2 less black cartridges at a lower price of the same capacity ink if you need or want to use color regularly.This review was updated after 4 months and approximately 10,000 pages printed on my Brother MFCJ6910DW MFC inkjet. So far, not a single smeared sheet, and the printer and cartridges work well together. The cost has been lowered from $28 to $19 and from shipped by store to shipped via Amazon prime. Ordering via prime is always nice, tracking works well, and total cost is clear at time of hitting one click. My cost per page is significantly lower due to the decrease in price.There is absolutely no reason to purchase branded Brother LC 79 ink cartridges in my opinion based on thousands of pages of printing. I also use OEM LC61 cartridges for another Brother inkjet printer and have printed over 3,000 sheets without incident.The cost per page with this product is amazingly low compared to using Brother brand cartridges.My use indicates approximately 2,000-2,500 sheets per black cartridge which varies a bit by how much black is in each page, and around 900-1,400 sheets per color cartridge. My color use tends to use a bit more blue, as a result my cyan tends to go first. Likely due to just having more blue per page than other colors. This is based on my personal printing experience with about 10,000 sheets over a 4.5 month period using a Brother MFCJ6910DW printer.Based on a my printing experience with this offer, cost per black and white page for ink is .19 (that is 1 fifth of a cent not 19 cents). Cost per page for color is 1.15 cents, with a lot of black cartridges left over. By comparison the cost of using Brother branded cartridges from Amazon would have been 3 cents per color page, and 1.25 cents per black and white page. Using Brother branded ink is at least 3 times and up to 6 times more expensive per page based on my use.My estimates assume 2 color cartridges print approximately 2,400 pages, and black cartridge will print about the same.

The output is not too dark, as is sometimes the problem with other inexpensive lasers.Manual Duplex printing - this was at first confusing to me because I wanted to use the lower paper tray to do it all: print one side and then feed the output back again into the lower tray to print the other side (if you have more than 50 sheets you need to use the lower tray).  This did not work for me until I finally hardwired the tray settings from &quot;auto detect&quot; to &quot;tray 1&quot;. The manual did not mention this step.  New drivers from Brother (as of January 14, 2004) did not fix this.  Printing duplex from the multi-purpose tray works fine without having to hardwire the settings.Customer support - so far not good.  I went through much trepidation figuring out how to get the lower tray to work on duplex because I could not reach support people.

I was trying to decide between it and another Fellowes ""small business"" class shredder that was on sale for $160, three times the price of the w-11c.  I've replaced enough shredders that I figured it would probably save money in the long run to get a top-of-the-line shredder and pay out the $160 instead of replacing the shoddy ones as they break down.I just couldn't bring myself to spend $160 on a shredder, though.  As much as logic and reason said it was the right thing to do, I couldn't make myself do it.  Instead, I bought the w-11c, in part based on the decent reviews I've seen on here.  I don't run a home business, I just have lots of junk mail, canceled checks, and other personal documents I'd rather not leave in the trash for thieves to steal.  That junk mail and those papers have been accumulating for 6 months, going in a big ""shred it when you get a new shredder box.""Well, today was this thing's trial by fire.  I emptied the box into the shredder and I was RELENTLESS.  Unopened credit card offers, old bank statements, several checkbook pads for an account I no longer have, and more.  I pushed the thing to its limit.  It definitely handles the advertised ""11 sheet"" capacity, though it does so with some protest and a very noticeable slowing of the shred speed.  It gets through it, though, and it's none the worse for wear.  Today alone, I had to empty the bin 9 times... and its still running great!  The construction is solid, safety features are great (the additional child safety lock on the top is really secure and impossible to override), and this thing can take whatever you throw at it, within reason.All in all, I'm very happy I saved $110 and went with the w-11c instead of the business-class unit.  If you shred perhaps 2 to 10 things per day, this is the ideal unit for you (especially if you don't like having to open junk mail envelopes before shredding 'em!)",4,Trial by fire - it passes with flying colors,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",356,1211,1221,0.991809992,helpful

Vista was just released and I didn't pay attention to the fact that particular HP printer didn't have the ""Certified for Vista"" label. Sadly, the printer drivers crashed my internet connection, caused blue screens, and a ""web printing"" plug-in made Internet Explorer unstable. Long story short, I ended up selling the HP printer and buying the ""Certified for Vista"" Epson Workforce 600 which worked like a dream!The Epson Workforce 610 is a minor iteration of the already excellent Workforce 600 with its pict bridge port, versatile memory card slots, fast print speeds and color LCD screen, but the 610 does have a few worthwhile improvements. The first major distinction is that the 610 has the official ""Compatible With Windows 7"" label which is huge if you're buying a computer with Windows 7 or upgrading! Chances are that most ""Vista Compatible"" printers will work with Windows 7 because the guts of the operating systems are so similar, but buying this printer lets you know for certain that you're buying something that works.As far as other improvements, standby power usage was trimmed from 5.5 to 2.9 Watts, and the user interface and ease of installation improved slightly, though according the the spec sheet, print speed actually decreased a little bit. I don't mind, however. Unless you print large quantities of long, detailed documents, chances are you won't be able to tell the difference, and the increased energy efficiency makes up for it.As with most Epson printers, a glaring advantage over the competition is the individual color print cartridges, which allow you to make the most of your ink by swapping out individual cyan, blue and magenta cartridges instead of one big ""color"" cartridge as with other brands.The biggest disadvantage compared to competing printers is the top-loading paper tray which I don't like as much a front-loading enclosed tray, and the weak implementation of two-sided printing which is little more than one sided printing where you reload the pages into the paper tray for a second pass.

I spent about 10 minutes reviewing the nicely organized and easy-to-understand instruction manual before I was well on my way to programming numbers and setting other features.  The sound quality has been consistently good and once you've reviewed the manual you'll find the buttons and features to be quite intuitive.From a practical standpoint, I was looking for a two-station cordless phone that does not have a built-in answering machine as I have voicemail with my phone service.  So this phone fit the bill.There are a couple of features I miss from my old phones I replaced--a belt clip (for trips to the garage when I don't want to miss a call) and a headphone jack. However, given the excellent price point of this product, I have no room to complain (For long conference calls I have been using the speakerphone feature, which also works well).  I read some reviews where people complained that this phone does not have distinctive ring tones.  If this is a feature you absolutely can't live without, look for a different product--remember, the price is great for what you get.In case you're wondering, I have had zero interference with my home wireless network, which would have prompted me to immediately return this product.The bottom line: If you're looking for a good-quality phone at a very attractive price, this is the one.",5,Great value for a great product,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",282,333,335,0.994029851,helpful

933528,AQFORCKKB6F8I,B005GSYNRM,Rough Customer,"[10, 11]","We just got this printer last week and I have been putting it thru the paces.  It sets up easily, user friendly, the color on photos is super, and even allows you to print color 4x6 photos with or without white borders.  I purchased separately 4x6 glossy Epson photo paper and 8 1/2 x11 Ultra Premium Matte presentation paper, and the results are spectacular.  I especially like the 4x6 color photos.I ink cartridges come with the printer (paper does not), and I also ordered two sets of the extra ink cartridges directly from Epson (as I could not find them on Amazon), and the ink cartridges come in two sizes, one for normal and one more expensive set for extended/heavy use.  The regular use cartridges from Epson cost about $25 per set, and the heavy duty-use cartridges cost around $45 for a set.On really nice feature of this printer is the slot for an SD memory chip on the left side, so that you can insert your camera memory chip directly into the printer without even having to turn on your computer, or go thru it.  You can print directly from the SD memory chip, the scanner on the top or via the wireless from existing photos/scans on your computer.I compared side by side, the quality of a print made on Epson glossy 4x6 paper made by this computer with a 4x6 print made on Kodak paper at the local drugstore photo print machine and the quality is the same (except the printer allows white borders which I like, the drug store prints did not), colors are almost exactly the same.All in all a great printer, small footprint (the control panel and paper reciever fold up into the printer), which I highly recommend!edit: Now it is Nov 3 and I have bought 4x6 photo print paper and high quality print paper...and extra color ink cartridge packs, as well as the SEPARATE black ink cartridge packs.  I am extremely happy and impressed with the 4x6 color photo printing quality, speed etc on this printer, as well as the color and black and white printing on the heavier paper.  I rarely append my reviews, but this printer is outstanding.  The only complaints I have about it are I can't figure out how to use  the scanner very well, nor print as well from an SD disk as I can from the computer.  I can print from the SD disk, so it is possible and you can even edit the photos from the display on the printer which is cool...just not as easy as it is from a wireless computer connected to the printer.  I did find out that when you buy a ""set"" of ink cartridges that the black cartridge is not included and must be purchased separately (which I did not know), I ended up buying extra high capacity black  cartridges (my thought being that I use more black due to printing text) and have been very very happy with the number of prints made, from each cartridge (longevity).

Brother cartridges say they are empty so much sooner than they really are.  There's a fix to that:  Take the toner drum out, then remove the cartridge, and then notice there are little circles on either side.  Cover them with tape.  They're optical sensors that try to see if there is toner left in the cartridge.  The problem is, the Brother printers will freak out several hundred pages too soon because of that sensor.  With as little printing as we do in our house, I taped the sensors and bought myself another year before I needed another toner cartridge (that's the point of a laser printer, after all-- high volume printing for cheap).When the toner finally ran out (really ran out), I ordered one of these cartridges.  Who really does stuff on paper any more?  This is mostly for casual printing (online coupons, maybe directions) or for the kids' school assignments.  Contrary to Michael Scott (The Office), businesses don't run on paper anymore.  This cartridge does just fine for that.However, enter in Brother's schemes to maximize their revenue.  That's fine; they can do these tricks all they want, so long as people like you are reading this and are realizing you can use their tricks in your favor and maximize pages out of the cartridges a bit farther, and then overcome the next hurdle that I had to deal with ....When I opened the new cartridge (which was shipped in practically bomb-proof packing, really beyond many things I have seen from Amazon before), I followed the 4 step directions and inserted the cartridge into the printer.  Then powered it back on, only to see the toner light again.  I used the tape method on the sensors (like above), but still ... toner light.  I then did some searching and found a neat little sequence of steps which sounded like they'd resolve my persistent problem:(For Brother 2170W)1. open the printer (toner door)2. power off the printer (switch, not power cord)3. close the printer door4. hold the ""GO"" button while flipping on the power switch5. after a couple seconds, let go, then push the ""GO"" button 2 more times, pause a couple seconds (lights will all go off), and then push the ""GO"" button 7 times in a row (lights will stay off until the end of the sequence).6. Lights should all come back on and the printer should return to normalSound good?  To no avail ... I then had to search further, only to find out that on the side of the toner cartridge (the part that you just bought that goes into the toner tray/drum), on the left side there is a little half-circle with a tab in it.  I read somewhere that the tab probably would be at the 3:00 position, but to move it to the 10:00 position.  I tried that and repeated the button sequence above 5 times-- no dice (that probably works for a different model of Brother printer or something).  But then I moved it all the way to the right, re-inserted, and ran the button sequence and Voila!  I finally am printing again.4 stars because the cartridge is good, but I had to go through that mess of steps and the time it took researching.  If I thought those steps were entirely this printer cartridge's fault, I'd give them a lower score.  Clearly it's Brother's fault, because I'm sure the Brother brand cartridges have the little tab in the correct place and the sensors work perfectly out of the box (as to trick you into thinking there is value from the extra $50 you'll spend on their brand cartridges).Bottom line, though: it was worth the hassle to save the $50 from this cartridge over the Brother brand cartridge.  Now that I've just recapped it for you (and more importantly: for me for next time in case I forget between now and the 2-3 years from now when I finally run this cartridge out), hopefully you won't have to waste the time I just did.",4,How To Fix the TONER light with this cartridge,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",715,44,44,1,helpful

I have been using Prismacolor pencils for more than 20 years, and the quality of these colored pencils cannot be beat, in my opinion. I have used expensive Derwent, Faber Castle, and many others. They are not as good, and I always end up reaching for my Prismacolors.Most important note:  The company packages the ""scholar"" line of pencils cheaply so that they can offer them at a lower price to art students who typically cannot afford high quality art supplies.The scholar pencils are just as nice as the professional ""artist"" line, which comes in metal tins or wooden boxes.Another note: ""wood casing"" in the description refers to the pencil itself. The pigment lead is ""encased"" in a wooden barrel. As you see by the picture, these are in a clear plastic case.A set of 24 Prismas will usually cost at least $24-25 in the cardboard or tin cases. Larger sets in those fancy wooden boxes can cost hundreds. Here you have a set of 24 in a plastic envelope thing, and this has caused people to give poor reviews and return the items. You bought some of the best pencils around for half price, people- the packaging is irrelevant! I noticed that these reviewers mentioned nothing about the pencils themselves. Are you kidding?I am an artist by profession, so I have plastic containers and drawers for all of my supplies. When I buy pencils they are going to go in the appropriate bin, so the packaging is not an issue- I prefer to pay for the contents. Other artists I know also store pencils in their own bins and boxes.I have to replace my colored pencils fairly often since I use them to the nub, and buying 24 for $12-13 is certainly a great thing. If you have to replace a single pencil you will pay at least a dollar per pencil at most craft stores, so no doubt this is an economical alternative. Most likely, You will use up these standard colors first.BTW- I see a picture of pencils in the plastic case up there for this item, so I don't know which product these other people are even looking at. Regardless, this set of 24 Prismacolor pencils is a steal. They are described as ""student"" quality, but do not let that fool you. These are not Crayolas by a long shot.

It takes about 20 minutes, but it's easy. Just follow the tablet instructions & videos. Another complaint from some was there was not a manual. Well, you can download it on the HP site. It explains everything! I think it rather funny that the people who complained about no manual didn't even think to read all the literature you can download from the HP web site. Nothing electronic anymore comes with a priinted manual. Manuals are all on pdf files now a days. I think the manual is also available on the CD.  If you're having trouble, at least go to the HP web site. There are steps there to walk you through set up and everything, if you you really want print.When you register at HP there is all kinds of support. There is a FAQ list. A ""How To"" list. And even, a very short list of problems and how to fix those. HP has listened to their customers and have addressed them. And, no I don't work for HP. Like I said, i was ready to send this back until I did the research, so I want to dispel the myths from the low reviewers.This is a great home station! I have printed an email from work with Adobe & Word attachments with no problem. The attachements came out perfectly formatted.I have sent pictures through eprint from my cell phone email. The photo quality is AWESOME! Brilliant & vibrant colors.The tablet (Zeen) is basically a Nook with loads of extras. The touch is sensitive, but it's a learning curve. It's an android tablet, so you can download some other apps, I'm told. And you can take it with you to a wireless cafe & browse your email, the internet, facebook, read an ebook, whatever, and then email what you like to your printer at home. It's not an IPAD or a Zoom, so don't think of it like that. If you think of it as a super cool Nook reader with extras, you'll love it. Hey, you're getting a cool basic tablet pc and a wireless printer for a great price. I don't think you can print wirelessly from those pricey tablets.This printer is for home use so a dedicated fax line isn't necessary unless you fax tons. I occassionally fax, so the EFAX 20 free faxes per month is great for me.It takes time to learn all that the printer and Zeen can do. Just be patient and you'll love this. Oh, and if the tablet is not attached to the printer, you still have print, copy, and scan functions available to you.The SD card slot on the tablet can be used to read all your SD cards and send stuff to the printer or just listen to music, watch videos, and view photos directly from the card.

Bleeding galore, especially with the Moleskines.Leuchtturm 1917 notebooks are a hardbound alternative with 80 gsm paper (there are older ones from 2009 out there with 70 gsm... avoid them and make sure you pick up the new version with the ink-proof symbol on the packaging). Despite the thin feel and look of the paper, there is minimal see through with my Pilot and no bleed through to speak of. The pages remain attractive and perfectly ledgible while writing/drawing on both sides of each page.Yes, there are notebooks out there with higher quality paper than the Leuchtturm... but you will certainly pay for the difference in going with a Rhodia Webnotebook ($25) or a Quo Vadis Habana ($20). Dollar for dollar, Leuchtturm blows Moleskine out of the water at $13 a pop.Aside from the paper quality, the other extra features really do make a big difference. The first three pages are designated as a useful table of contents for easy reference. Each page is numbered (and tastefully in small print) and there are labels for the cover and spine included. But best of all is that the graph lines & numbers are printed on the paper very lightly... meaning that nothing of the lines will distract while you draw or transfer if you photocopy your work.

It is nearly impossible to identify callers by the sound of their voice because this machine alters and distorts the voices so much.  All messages are recorded with a very poor ""digital-like"" electronic sound quality which is very choppy and unnatural (like a very bad 'futuristic' movie from the early 60's).  It's almost as if little bits of the digital data are being discarded instead of recorded in order to save memory space.  It also severely limits the audio frequencies of the recording which makes words muffled and unintelligible (""S""'s sound like ""F""'s, etc.).For example, she might have left you a message that said ""last night was just heaven"", but you might have thought she said ""last night was just a seven"" -- not exactly a confidence-builder, if you know what I mean.  The sound quality is so poor it's almost as if the caller were holding a cloth over the phone to disguise their voice.  (Then again, maybe those ARE blackmailers who keep calling me.  It's hard to tell.)What that all means to you is that if someone calls and leaves a message like ""Honey, don't bother to pick up the kids this afternoon because I'm going to do it on the way home"" you just better hope it's not a wrong number because you will have no way of knowing that the voice on the other end wasn't that of your wife.It's too bad because AT&T; used to make very high quality products.  Now I suppose they just license their name to anyone who will pay them to use it.  I know choices are limited for answering machines, but my recommendation is to stay far away from this one.

935407,A3SD3E6FIS6CS9,B005HFJFKE,Marine Corps Nomad,"[12, 14]","As a homeschooler, my printer gets a real workout day in and day out. I tend to be fairly hard on our printers because of this fact.  I need a printer that can handle all types of paper including cardstock, and this printer handled all different types and weights of paper with ease.  The duplex mode is also critical due to the number of pages we print.  While testing out the printer, I didn't experience any paper jams which can sometimes happen when using duplex mode with larger documents.  Wireless printing is another important feature for our printers because we do not keep the printer near the computer.Set-up:Set-up for the printer was a breeze. Getting the printer connected to the wireless network was extremely simple. It can be done directly on the printer or on the computer once software is installed. The printer does feature Airprint technology, but I did not use this feature.Ease-of-use:For the most part, the printer is easy to use once you get all the tape and packaging materials removed. The printer features 2 trays: 4X6 photo tray and traditional photo tray which holds a variety of sizes including letter and legal. It also has the capability to print on cds/dvds. The sliders on the trays (to adjust paper size) do stick at first, so you have to finesse them into place.The duplex (two-sided) printing allows you to save money on paper costs. When you add using draft mode, you'll also able to cut down on print costs.  The individual color ink cartridges allow users to change only the colors they use most frequently. While some people do not like the multiple ink cartridges, I appreciate them as there are definitely some colors that get used more frequently than others, so I appreciate being able to save money by just replacing that particular ink color.Concerns:On multiple occasions, I had issues with the printer cancelling a print job for large documents. I did not have this issue with smaller print jobs, so it may be a spooler issue?  I do not have this issue on my hp printer, so I was a little disappointed to see this happening.Another problem is the inability to feed documents for scanning/copying. You have to scan/copy each page individually. Obviously, this is just a personal preference, but it is a feature that I feel important.Final Thoughts:The printer prints with vibrant colors. The photos comes out looking beautiful.  It also works great as a document printer.  The duplex printing as well as multiple ink color cartridges are nice economical features. While I did run into a few issues as mentioned above, the printer did a nice job with the various print jobs as long as I kept the limitations in mind (create small print jobs). The printer works well with our Windows 7 computers and wireless network.If you're looking for a space saving printer, this may not be the printer for you as it does have a fairly big footprint.  That being said, it's much smaller than many of the office printer available.Will it hold up to rigorous use over time?

The only thing in Carla's paw was a spatula -- as it should be! If Carla had to write something on her grocery list, she did it with crayon or lipstick. Just like her grandmother taught her.Then Darlene Jablonski, the googly-eyed feminist from our supper club, got Carla this set of these Bic ""For Her"" pens.

I am clueless as to why Olympus does not tout the remarkable quality of the prints produced on this printer. I looked at all the photo printers available, extensively read tons of reviews on inkjet, laser and dye sublimitation. The inkjets have improved a lot over the years, but the quality is still inkjet. Lots of ink sprayed on various types of paper produces pixelation and a picture that cannot stand up to the slightest smudge or drop of water. The laser printers were the next best bet, but they didn't seem to have the kind of depth that was needed. With the dye sublimitation, you get a seemless picture that is covered with a protective layer at the end of the printing process.However, there is a price for that kind of quality. It costs about twice as much as each page printed on any other type of printer, and at this time I think only Olympus makes the paper. Perhaps this is due to some sort of patent law. But, if you want a great picture every time, and are not interested in printing tee shirt transfers, or fridge magnets, this is the printer for you.A little update, 6 months after purchase, still love this printer, people are always amazed at the quality of prints, you will not be able to tell the difference between the photo lab pics and the pics made from this printer.  The PC card slot allows almost all media, but I never use it because a multimedia adapter is always quicker and I never print from just the printer, I always use the computer.  Some of my relatives have printers with different slots, but they are so slow it just always seems easier to slide a card reader into a USB slot and just dump the photos.  I wouldn't make this an issue though, because camera media will always be changing. Also, it is true that this printer cannot print a true 8x10, so I just leave a hair of white paper around the edge.  Besides that though, the printer is still working out great. It would be nice if the price of consumables went down, but at least you know when you print the picture it is going to look like a professional job.

1062587,A2PVKZECMC1JP4,B008FYGJ3A,Kieron Brogan,"[169, 184]","We can't get this printer in the UK yet so I had to purchase from the US but apart from a brief stay in customs it all arrived fine. The single reason for purchasing the printer is that it can print directly from an iPad over WiFi without needing the need for a router and it does that just great and I'm very happy with the print quality. There are a couple of points to be aware, it uses coloured film to produce the photo and it does it a layer at a time printing CMYK so the paper is passed back and forth through the printer 4 times laying down each colour. This means it is a little slow printing but the resulting photo is totally dry and ready to handle as soon as it is finished and the film cartridges are easy to handle and as the printer is portable means there will be no spills and leaks as it gets thrown around. The cartridges do have a fixed number of prints they can produce and the one that comes with the printer is only capable of 5 so make sure you order more cartridges and paper as once a cartridge has produced its set number of prints its useless, you can't squeeze another print out, you can't refill them. As the cartridges are basically a spool of coloured film its also important to understand that printing a little colour of pic of something is going to use up one print, the same as printing a full borderless image so there is no point in trying to be efficient and conserve 'ink'. However buying more cartridges and paper isn't too expensive and you can get kits that bundle them together but it does means being reliant on Canon as no one else can produce 'refills. Another thing to point out is that if you want truly portable printing and go for a battery option you also need a charger and the two of them together cost more than the printer itself and they set external to the printer and plug into the power port on the printer so the printer is never free of wires. This is a real shame and its unfortunate that Canon couldn't find a way of making the battery clip on to the printer itself but I guess one positive is that as the battery is pretty large, much larger than anything for a camera or camcorder it should last a long time in between charges. In summary I am really happy with the printer and everyone I have shown it to agrees and if you need photo printing on the move with an iPad, iPhone etc its really the only option I have found that does it this well, yes its a pain the battery is external and you yes you need special consumables but all in all I have no regrets purchasing it. Oh and one last thing, I wanted to take full size screen prints from the iPad (pushing the Home and Sleep button together) and print them out but if you do that you can only print with a border and not borderless as it cuts off the edges of the image so if you find prints losing part of the image switch borderless printing off. This is done within the Canon app for the iPad/iPhone which you need to download to use with the printer, you can't print natively from the iPad direct to the printer in the way AirPrint works you do need the free Canon app.",5,Great LIttle Printer,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",599,169,184,0.918478261,helpful

Profiling your monitor helps immensely with any printer.  However, most amateurs aren't going to do that.  Epson's paper profiles are good and you should try to adjust your monitor to see the same thing that's on the finished print.  Make sure you let the print dry throughly before judging it.  A couple of hours or a hairdryer will vastly improve the prints looks.Ink costs about 75 cents for a full bleed 8.5x11 inch print.  First rate paper varies from 20 cents to a dollar a sheet.  The R3000 is quite efficient in its use of ink compare to earlier Epson printers.  However, constantly changing from matte paper to glossy paper and then back to matte will cost you about $4 for each round trip in wasted ink.  So, you're better off sticking to one surface or another.

It's now April 2012 and I still love everything about Ooma.>I should start by saying that I'm a phone geek and I've tried many many different types of cell phones, VOIP, and landline.For VOIP I've used Vonage, Packet8, Skype, Iaxtel, Lingo, and more. I found that most of them were either difficult to set up or maintain. The exception was Vonage, which was easy to set up, but expensive and was incompatible with my old apartment complex's buzzer. So for the past year I went back to a normal landline, without any features or long distance ($23/month, but good quality and complete compatability.)I've been using Skype for long distance during this year, and it was okay because it was cheap, but the quality wasn't great.Ooma solved all this!Within 10 minutes of opening the box I had the product activated and plugged in. After about 10 more minutes it had finished doing the updates and was ready to use. I placed and received test calls and the call quality sounded great to me and to the people on the other end of the line! And these test calls were done while downloading torrent files at my maximum download speed. Everything works as advertised: Caller ID, voicemail, long distance, etc. I also really like that Ooma gives a dialtone (many VOIP decides do not.)In addition, the unit looks SEXY! Most of the time when I have VOIP equipment it is bulky and you can tell that a geek owns it. This is so stylish that I don't think anyone would mind having it in their home. At only $0 the first year and $11.75 the every additional year, the price can't be beat.Additional Info: I have cable internet, and Ooma Telo is installed after my router. My router is running DD-WRT which has QoS built into it. If none of this means anything to you--that's okay!

Wow, what an incredible calculator that was for its time.  It lasted me nearly 30 years (still going actually).  I recently purchased a 50g & am blown away by its capabilities.  Along with the amazing graphing, equation writing/solving & memory capabilities come definite, albeit unavoidable, complexities in the form of button-pushing.  Others have complained about the fact that one button can take on up to 6 different functions, depending on which shift or alpha key combination you press first.  This is not complicated nor hard to learn.  I'm basically learning by practicing & all is well.  This calculator has more capability than I will probably ever use.  It has the ability to operate in either RPN or Algebraic entry mode.  I've used RPN forever, so that's my default mode.  It turns out that the Equation Writer does operate in Algebraic mode - no big deal.  I would not recommend this calculator to someone who's not on a math/science/engineering track.  It has features you'll never use.  These technical disciplines attract individuals with a mind-set that's well-matched to learning & understanding the 50g in a time-efficient manner.  If you just need a calculator to get you through a required algebra or calculus class - & that's it - there may be other calculators out there with a reduced feature set that would suffice for you.  Along w/ the HP 50g's unparalleled features comes what I would consider a reasonable learning curve (for me).  I do this stuff all the time, so it's worth putting some time in to learn it.  Some of the more negative reviews of this calculator make mention of the significant learning curve.  This may be true if you're not adept at learning/understanding math notation, &/or don't have a need for the 50g's capabilities on an ongoing basis.  This can probably be said if any higher end graphics/engineering calculator.  If you don't use it with some regularity, you may need to relearn certain procedures later on.In summary, if you're a technical individual who understands math & science, & you're wanting a calculator that can do just about anything you'd ever ask ... this is the calculator for you.

Going into the exchange, I had high hopes that the Panasonic, with four years of technology advancement, would exceed my expectations in most, if not all, areas of performance compared to my old Vtech LS5145/LS5105 phone set; however, the experience has fallen just a bit shy of what I was hoping for.  For what it's worth to others who may be at a similar cross-roads, here are my observations/impression following the ""upgrade:""Pros (with notes comparing to my old Vtech LS5145 + LS5105 handsets):- DECT 6.0 Digital Enhanced Communications between handsets and base station ( IIRC, my old Vtech model was unencrypted spread spectrum )- Talking Caller ID ( Pretty cool as my old Vtech phones did not talk... )- Standard AAA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries instead of custom battery pack ( For comparison, my old Vtech uses custom battery pack BT5872 )- Link 2 Cell Phones via Bluetooth (Supports one linked cell call and one landline call simultaneously, same as my old Vtech)- 30 Number Call blocking (No call blocking on VTech, IIRC)- 18 Minutes record capability (I believe the Vtech did something on the order of 15 min instead)- 13 Hour Talk Time (Advertised at least... and the old VTechs are nowhere close at an advertised 4.5 hours talk time, IIRC)- Backlit keypads (Old VTech keypad was backlit as well, though I'm not sure one is better than the other, but back-lighting is good!)- No annoyingly bright power/charge/locator light (Old VTech lit room up at night with bright blue light...)- Cellular Only mode if you've gotten rid of your land-line (Must admit I don't know how/if the Vtech handled this scenario as I've always had a land line)- Base and Handsets have speaker phone capability (Seemingly comparable to my old Vtech model)- Intercom Capability between handsets (Had hoped functionality would be equivalent to the Vtech, but have yet to figure out how to do a ""global"" intercom to all other handsets)- Total feature set somewhat comparable (except, apparently, the Vtech global intercom function, and the Vtech battery backup on base station)- Big plus:  5 handset set readily available for not much more that what it would cost me to replace the failing battery packs in my 5 Vtech handsets and base station.Cons (At least as compared to the old VTech phones)- DECT 6.0 is supposed to provide better sound quality, but I'm not convinced as the new phones seem to have a constant ""static hiss/noise"" that I'd never really noted in the Vtechs.- VTech was able to intercom call to all handsets simultaneously as well as 1 to 1...  only been able to do 1 to 1 on Panasonic (so far, at least...)- Monotone handset display as compared to VTech color handset display- Maximum of 6 possible handsets total compared to, I believe, 12 for the VTech- Charger Bases and phones feel lighter/cheaper than old VTech, in my opinion at least- Not as sleek and designer-esque as the old VTech Phones, again, in my opinion at least- Apparently, No Backup power on the base station... which is odd because the previous Panasonic model (KX-TG7645) apparently had it (VTech has battery backup in base unit)- Durability compared to old VTech TBD...So it's really something of a ""mixed bag.""  The Panasonics appear to be, more or less, feature-comparable phones with new batteries and, supposedly, more secure wireless communications than before ( I was previously banking on the spread spectrum stuff making the VTech phones pretty hard to listen in to, but now DECT 6.0 supposedly provides digital encryption, the strength of which might be somewhat questionable, on top of what I can only hope is some form of spread spectrum with frequency hopping communications... though I can't seem to confirm any of this on Panasonic's website, so depending on how mandatory the security features are on any given DECT 6.0 Plus implementation the Panasonics ""may"" be more secure).  I'm just a bit concerned that I can't seem to find any Panasonic literature addressing the security aspects/features of this phone.  On the positive side, the cost was not much more than the battery replacement cost would have been for the VTech phones.  Biggest disappointment so far is the background static noise that will probably irritate me more the more I continue to think about it.  Just might be enough of a reason not to recommend these phones... but the talking caller ID is really cool!  The Panasonic model (KX-TG7645) from last year got really good reviews and this year's model (KX-TG7745) simply appears to be a refresh with better iPhone integration, so I figured this year's model would be as good, if not better than, last year's.  Perhaps that's where I went wrong?  Anyone compared a KX-TG7645 against the KX-TG7745 as regards static/background/hiss noise present on the handsets?  Anyway, perhaps I'm being a bit over-critical of the ""hiss"" as souund quality seems fairly acceptable overall when you're not listening to the hiss during silent moments.  It just stands out to me since I don't recall having such an issue with the old Vtech model, though it may simply be a case of better noise reduction circuitry on the old Vtech as compared to the Panasonics.  Will see if I can acclimate to the hiss over time or not...UPDATE/EDIT 09 JUNE 2012:  Updated original review to indicate that the KX-TG7745S does indeed support both a landline call and a cell call simultaneously.  For example, a linked cell call can be placed from one handset while a landline call is already in progress on another handset.  In such a case, both calls proceed simultaneously.  There seems to be a lot of confusion online regarding this capability with some reviewers stating that the KX-TG7745S cannot do this; however, I have successfully performed this very exercise with my KX-TG7745S.  Having said that, what does appear to be a limitation is that, according to the manual, only one linked Bluetooth device may be ""connected"" at a time.  Unfortunately, the manual author's use of the word ""connected"" is confusing and somewhat absurd sounding.  ""What?  I can only have one Bluetooth device ""connected"" at a time???""  If true, this would make it almost pointless for the unit to support linking of two phones as the second phone would not be able to ""connect"" once the first one did.  Or, for that matter, neither cell phone would be able to connect if a Bluetooth headset was connected to the phone system first!  Anyway, I believe what the author meant to say is that, while both cell phones can be linked/connected simultaneously, only one linked/connected Bluetooth device may be in active use at a time.  This means that if a linked cell call is in progress on one handset and you pick up another handset to try making a call from the other linked cell phone, the handset will indicate that the phone is ""busy"" and you will not be able to access the second cell phone.  Furthermore, if the maual is correct in what it states, the use of a Bluetooth headset during a landline call would seem to exclude the use of either cell phone during that time, thus making it impossible to make/receive a linked cell phone call while the Bluetooth headset is in use.  If true, that sorta stinks.  Will have to hunt down my Bluetooth headset and test this out at some point to see if it is true.  Now for one last note:  While your cell phone is linked/connected to the base station, it is pretty much worthless for making/receiving cell calls directly through the cell phone itself as, at least with my phones, the speaker and probably the microphone are apparently disabled while linked.  I assume this is for privacy and energy reduction while in use through the handset phone system; however, it means you will need to disconnect/de-link your cell phone before you can reasonably use it directly.  Would be nice if the cell phones were smart enough to de-link/disconnect automatically when accessed directly so that you could simply pick up your cell phone and use it as normal at any time.  The cell phone could then automatically reconnect after you've completed your call and put the cell phone back down.  Or, pherhaps the cell phones could simply provide an easily accessible quick-disconnect button to allow you to decide whether you want to disconnect quickly or simply stay connected while you access other non-call related features of your cell phone.  Better yet, just have the cell phone automatically disconnect when I go to dial a number or receive a call directly from the cell phone... and then reconnect when I'm done.  Sounds pretty straight-forward to me.  Perhaps some cell phones are this intelligent; however, mine don't appear to be.  Take a ""hint"" cell phone manufacturers!  Here's something you can improve!!!Also, in investigating possible explanations for the low level background hiss/noise I've previously reported with my KX-TG7745S and in light of the glowingly good reviews everyone seems to have given the older KX-TG7645M, I've been scrutinizing the differences between them to see if there can be any explanation.  This evening, while holding boxes for each of the two models, a possible explanation jumped out at me:  The KX-TG7645M box touts the units superior sound quality performance due to employing ""Range Boost antenna technology;"" however, there is no mention of Range Boost antenna technology on the KX-TG7745S packaging!!!  The KX-TG7645M box even goes on to note something to the effect that the Range Boost antenna technology can provide up to something like a 20% improvement in talking quality as compared to Panasonic products employing standard DECT 6.0 Plus technology without the RangeBoost antenna!  Can anyone confirm for certain that the improved Range Boost antenna technology has truly been left off of this new KX-TG7745S model?  If so, I'm becoming even more convinced that the KX-TG7745S is even more of a manufacturing cost reduction stripped down KX-TG7645M imposter than I previously thought.  FYI, here's a recap of the features in which the KX-TG7745S currently appears deficient with respect to the KX-TG7645M:KX-TG7645M advertises Range Boost antenna technology while the KX-TG7745S is apparently absent such technology (If true, could forecast lower quality sound on the 7745 vs. the 7645)KX-TG7645M provides power backup capability for operating base station during a power outage while the KX-TG7745S lacks this feature and will cease to operate during a power outage.KX-TG7645M appears to have a voice memo function while the KX-TG7745S appears to be absent this function.Only new feature I've identified for the KX-TG7745S (other than the obvious aesthetic changes) is the addition of a side mounted volume control rocker switch... which, for me, actually seems harder to use than the front panel rocker volume switch anyway!I can't say for sure whether the KX-TG7645M is better than this model or not, but the specs are starting to stack up in its favor and I think I'm going to be looking into it.  If my suspicions turn out to be true I'll likely be sending the KX-TG7745S back home to mama...  stay tuned for the next update!UPDATE 16 JUNE 2012:  Ok, my new KX-TG7645M is now here for comparison against my previously purchased KX-TG7745S and the sound quality of the 7645 does seem somewhat better than that of the 7745, at least in my particular application anyway.  There is still some low level white-noise hiss notable in the 7645 during silent moments; however, the more static-like noise present in the 7745 seems to be gone in the 7645.  Surprisingly, I'd have to give the ease of use approval to the 7745 over the 7645; however, the 7645 wins the aesthetics competition hands down!  I won't bore you with all the details here, but if you really want to know the nitty gritty details of my observations, see the 7745 vs. 7645 discussion thread available below.Oh, and I don't believe the 7733 has the Range Boost or reversible handset features either, contrary to the comparison chart as it currently stands on the product page.

447125,A3NZFCRNAGO99Z,B001DJ6C2W,Amazon Customer,"[23, 24]",I wanted an all in one printer that worked wirelessly and this printer seemed like my best bet after reading all the reviews. I have used the printer for almost two weeks now on a Windows XP system and on a Vista system running 64 bits. Here is my evaluation so far. I will list pros and cons up front for those that don't want to read my whole review.ProsGreat prints both normal and photoExtremely fastGreat scans for normal documents and 35 mm film if done correctlyVery easy to set up on new computers once you get it working on a single computer wirelessly.Nice software controls that work well with PhotoshopConsHorrendous documentationVery confusing setting up for wireless access on Windows XP for initial setup.No document feeder for copying multipage documentsSetup:Very bad experience for me. I took the printer out of the box and tried to decipher the instructions so that I could print wirelessly using Windows XP. I knew in advance this would be an issue from prior reviews but figured as an experienced computer user I should be ok. Not so. You HAVE to install the software first on your computer before ever hooking the printer to it. You also must start using a USB cable and be sure to enable the wireless feature in the printer using the menu system on the printer itself. Turn the printer off and then hook it up to your computer. The configuration utility will then allow you to set the computer up for first time use on a wireless LAN. Enter your WEP keys if needed. You MAY have to create a port for using the printer wirelessly. It is not entirely clear in the documentation but that caused some grief. After you have configured the printer for wireless use then detach it from the computer and turn it off and on again. It should come up as a printer you discover wirelessly your computer. Once you can attach to it you should have no problems.Printing:The printer is lightning fast even in regular mode. I was blown away how fast it is so this is a major plus. I HATE the fact that there is no document feeder. This means I have to keep my old HP printer around for bulk copying of documents which is really annoying. Contrary to some prior post you CAN have HP printers work with this printer without an issue. I am doing it. Photos print fantastically well but in order to get the best color match I used the Adobe RGB 98 profile with Photoshop. The printer has a variety of profiles and is very very tweakable which is really helpful. Full bleed photos were so good my friends could not believe they came from this printer. I used the Canon photo plus glossy II 4x6 photo paper. Set that output for the printer so that it optimizes for that printing surface.Scanning:Contrary to another reviewer I had absolutely no problems scanning over the net. Interface to Photoshop 7.01 and CS4 was flawless and the scanner utility is very nice and tweakable. For the person that said it looked very digital I would suggest setting the DPI values in advanced settings up to the max 4800 dpi since the default is 1200. I scanned 35mm film negatives and was blown away how well they came out. The instructions for the use of the film scanning tray are sketchy but eventually I figured it out and am thrilled about the way I can use it. Scanning photos worked really well also. If you use Photoshop you don't have to have the scanning utility do the work of removing dust etc but it does have that feature if you want it.I would have given this printer 5 stars if it had a document feeder and the setup and documentation were better. If judged for scanning and printing only I would absolutely give it 5 stars. My daughter is an animator and artist and she needed a printer that would provide accurate color and she is very happy with it. I will say that it worked without any problems on 64 bit Vista using Adobe Photoshop CS4 which was really nice.,4,Great printer and scanner but terrible documentation,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",701,23,24,0.958333333,helpful

From appearance to function this is a first rate product at what I consider to be a very fair price. The shell looks, feels, and performs like quality leather with perfect stitching, rolled edges, and a reinforced binding panel. The front and back leather panels enclose rigid but lightweight inserts (probably plastic), that give the folio just the right balance between heft and support to be able to write on your lap, knee, or holding it in your opposing hand. The expandable inside doc pocket swings open of its own accord and will fit approximately a magazine and 50 sheets of paper.The outside of the doc pocket is also reinforced, and features a YKK black nylon zippered compartment for paper items, pens, etc., and outside of which are stitched three very slim pockets for what appears to be business cards and cd/dvd's, or other assorted flat items. The actual writing paper is your basic 8.5x11"" pad refill, which can be purchased virtually anywhere. And topping off the features is the three-sided YKK black nylon zipper which seals the folded padfolio, and which I find absolutely indispensable insurance against losing any loose contents. The only thing I didn't get about the near flawless design of this padfolio was the placement of the pen loop. It's actually in the upper left corner of the left inside panel, about 1.5"" from the top edge, instead of in the middle of the panel, which makes me have to flatten the zipper in order to insert the pen. Truly a minor design flaw, and nowhere near a deal breaker, just questionable.Bonus: I took this to my first team meeting at the clinic where I just started a new job and actually got compliments on it :)Update: After a couple of months of use I've come to the conclusion that I was wildly optimistic thinking that the expandable doc pocket would fit a magazine and 50 sheets of paper. The reality is that because the seam that connects the doc pocket to the leather shell has no channel or cup to it, the bottom of the pocket is a 'V'. The more sheets you put into it, the further the papers get pushed out of bottom seam. The reality is that I can just barely fit 25 sheets of copy paper, and that backs the paper right up to the outside zipper. If the padfolio was wider or the pocket had a 1/2"" channel, my original review would have been accurate. While it's still an indispensable item for my work and a very good value , and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one, I really wish I could tweak this a tiny bit more.

After some research (and the fact that it went on sale at Office Depot), I decided on the HL-2240. My first impression ... it's a lot noisier than my 1440 was. Part of the reason is because Brother decided to shift the exhaust fan from the left side to the right side of the printer (something I didn't notice in the store), so I now I get to listen to it until it decides to shut off and go back into sleep mode. I can handle noise while the actual printing is taking place (and it does make it's fair share of noise while printing), but I don't really appreciate having to listen to the exhaust fan hum for 3 minutes afterwards. So this being the case, you might want to consider getting the higher end model with networking capability so you can locate the printer farther away from your desk. USB cables don't come in long enough lengths to allow relocation of the printer to someplace where the noise won't be so annoying.

If you look at the picture, bear in mind that the photo it is ejecting is 4x6; that gives you a sense of scale.The output was amazing. I don't know how accurate the color reproduction is, because I didn't get to play with the originals on the SD card, but the pictures certainly looked nice. (I'm the only one in the family who might care about color calibration.)The LCD display is reasonably large for such a tiny machine, and it has a number of ways to manually adjust the images but we didn't try any of them. It does red-eye and lighting correction automatically. We wanted this to be plug-and-play, and that's the way we used it.

I vowed never to do that again.  After printing about 35 pages (front and back of the page)with about 35 to 40 percent full color coverage each page and the rest just regular black text the color ink told me i needed ink and the level showed less than 20 percent remaining on the color.  The black still had about 70 percent remaining, but I thought that this was ridiculous how little color you can print with these expensive inks so I looked online for refills and found a lot of them and decided to go with the InkTec ones.When I got them, I followed the directions in print and did the process at the same time as watching the refill video for this product on YouTube.  The process was very simple and you don't need any tools other than the ones they send you in the box.  It was not messy at all, I did not even need to use the gloves they sent.After refilling both inks, I placed them back in the printer and the printer would not recognize the cartridges and told me there were no cartridges installed.  I thought that this was going to turn out to be a disaster because I remembered reading the reviews before buying and someone else had the same problem.  I turned the printer off and back on and the inks were instantly recognized.  Next, I did the cartridge cleaning process like they recommended and I also aligned the cartridges with the hp software.  After this they were printing fine and I could not see any difference between these and the regular hp inks.The only thing is that on the refilled inks your pc will not be able to give you the level of the inks anymore, it will tell you that it cant read the ink level, I knew this before buying and its really not a big deal.  Once you refill the inks before the sponge inside dries out I think you will be fine.I will never pay for regular inks again, this way I am paying about $2 for a full refill of both inks whereas with the original hp inks I am paying $125.  I wish more people would try this and not submit to the scare tactics employed by these big printer companies to try and stop you from refilling inks so that they can charge you an arm and a leg for them.  That's where they are really making the money, not from the printers, it's from the inks.  Keep your old cartridges, refill them before they run out and when you go into the store and they say oh do you want to drop your old cartridges in the recycling box over there, don't do it, they know if you don't have the cartridge then you can't refill it.  That's why I kept all my cartridges when they asked me.  You won't void your warranty (I researched it and it's illegal for them to void your warranty for using refilled inks) and you won't see any noticeable difference in the quality.",5,Saved Me A Lot of Money,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",614,14,14,1,helpful

I shoot medium format film through a Fuji GA645, a camera justifiably well known for having a razor sharp lens, near perfect exposure, and to-die-for autofocus.  Imagine my surprise when my first negatives scanned soft and out of focus.So I poke around Flickr a bit and discover that film laid flat on the scan bed with the film holder pressing it to the glass gives markedly better results than actually inserting the film in the holder as instructed by Epson.  10 minutes of swearing while trying to accomplish this not so easy feat (go ahead and try for yourself), and 20 minutes of scanning (while still swearing) later, I discover that, lo and behold, the Flickr folks are right.Negatives flat on the glass scan vastly better than negatives in the holder.  In fact, at 4800dpi, negatives flat on the glass so exceed my needs that I turned the resolution down a notch.  I'll go one step further and say that if Epson had included film holders that weren't total GARBAGE, i.e., a double glass plate system designed to hold the negative at EXACTLY THE FOCAL PLANE, I might be giving this system five stars instead of one.I don't know what misbegotten moron over at Epson decided to cheap out, and I don't care.  I'll be searching the web for some sort of film holder that actually, you know, WORKS, (or other solution, maybe I can design and manufacture my own, get rich fixing Epson's grievous failings) since laying it on the glass in perfect alignment without curl or dust is such a monumental pain.  If I can't find a solution shortly, this thing is going to be returned, and good riddance.It'll be a cold day in damnation before I buy another Epson product.EDIT:  Ok, it is possible to get somewhat decent scans out of this heap.  Follow these instructions:First, turn your film holder over and pull out the little feet.  Turn them around 180 degrees so the arrow points toward the plus sign, then put them back in.  For some reason the focal plane is a bit high off the glass, about 3.5mm.  Guess how high the feet are set at the factory?  If you guessed 3.0mm, give yourself a gold star.Way to go, Epson, you big wet bag of smelly FAIL.If that doesn't work, then turn your Adjustment Options completely off and run a test scan.  According to the Photo-i review I read, Digital ICE in Quality mode is garbage, while Digital ICE in Speed mode is actually somewhat useful.  Your mileage may vary.If your scans still look awful, plug betterscanning into your search engine and go buy a new film holder.  Everyone that's ever used those aftermarket jobbies (that I could find, anyway) says they see a marked improvement.  As it is apparent from even web sized photos that they're designed and constructed better than the OEM GARBAGE, I can see why.For real black and white film (not the chromagenic C-41 process stuff, scan that stuff just like color, only with Image Type set to 16 bit grayscale) turn off all the adjustment options except possibly Unsharp Mask.  Of course, since you're going to be slowly going crazy in Photoshop with the Spot Healing Brush taking out all the dust, you might as well turn that off too, since even at Medium the Unsharp Mask sometimes gets a bit of aliasing on diagonal lines.I reiterate: You could not pay me enough to own another Epson product.",1,You've got to be kidding me!,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",597,65,79,0.82278481,helpful

Yes, the paper is curled slightly when it first comes out, but if you set it aside on a flat surface and let it cool for a few seconds, the paper will flatten out by itself.  I have seen other laser printers that do far worse curling.Network setup is very easy, especially if you're using Mac OS X Tiger or Panther.  I was able to connect both with Bonjour/Rendezvous wirelessly via Linksys 802.11g router after installing drivers downloaded off Brother's website.  Also was able to connect a PC running Win XP, which required an extra step or two.  After you're connected, if you need to change any default printer settings, it's all done through a web interface (both FireFox and Safari worked fine).Overall print quality is noticeably better than any inkjet and as good, if not better than similar laser printers in this class.  Even graphic printouts were much better than I had expected and is perfectly fine for non-photo quality jobs.  There are settings for 300/600/1200 dpi, a toner saver feature, power saver timeout, print density, and paper type selector (someone mentioned that selecting ""thin"" paper type causes less curling).  Various other advanced printer and networking settings, and emulation modes exist also.Print speed is very good.  It takes about 10 seconds from the time I click the Print button to when 1 page in 600dpi with a fair amount of of text is printed out, even having just awakened from sleep mode.  No problems printing out MS Word, Excel, and Adobe Acrobat documents.I've printed a couple hundred pages so far, and have not experienced any printer errors or paper jams.

I reckon the holidays must have delayed the shipment. I have seen it selling for a little less elsewhere, but taking into consideration that shipping was free and I didn't have to pay sales tax in California, it was the best deal.I have a Powerbook running Mac OS-X 10.3.8 and I had the printer working in about 15-20 minutes after opening the box. There is no USB cable or a manual. A PDF manual is supplied in the CD-ROM along with the print driver. Just make sure you purchase a USB cable. I got an inexpensive Belkin USB cable from Amazon.The supplied HP print driver is version 1.1.3 and it prints the pages in reverse order by default. The printer puts out the pages face down, so you have to rearrange the pages in the proper order every time. I am a writer and I print out over 100 pages at a time, so that can be a big problem. I searched for a newer version of the print driver on the HP website, but they only had version 1.1.3 for download. I emailed Tech Support at HP on a Saturday and received a reply from them on Monday. They informed me that Version 4 of the print driver can be downloaded via an FTP address, which they emailed me. I don't know why they didn't make the latest print driver available on the HP website in the first place. I downloaded Version 4 and everything has been smooth sailing ever since. I have to commend HP Tech Support for their timely response and effectively solving my problem.Regarding the speed of the HP 1012.... It puts out the first page in less than 10 seconds. It is very quiet, because it doesn't have a fan. I have heard that the printer slows down after 50-plus pages while doing my research prior to purchasing it. Honestly, that concerned me. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I printed a manuscript that was 106 pages long. My printer never slowed down! Although the printer did get rather warm without a fan, it kept putting out the pages at the same consistent pace. I've printed 100-plus page manuscripts several times now with the same results. Even then, if you are doing extensive printing jobs, expect it to slow down. Otherwise, you might be better off getting a different printer that can handle the volume.I bought the printer for printing text and the results are sharp and clear. I considered the Samsung 1710 and 1740 and a couple of Brother printers in the same price range. I soon learned that Samsung stopped supporting Mac OS-X. While less expensive, Brother printers require a separate toner and drum, thus making the operating costs higher in the long run. The HP 1012 has the toner and drum combined together in one cartridge, so there are no expensive drum replacements. I've heard some people complain about the $69 price for the HP 1012 toner cartridge. You won't see me complaining, because I will not be paying $150 for a separate drum replacement. Besides, I've seen a new HP 1012 toner cartridge selling substantially less than $69 on the web.For my requirements, the HP 1012 was my only choice and the best choice.  I've had the HP 1012 for 3 months now, and I've purposely waited this long to write this review so I can fully evaluate it. Aside from initial print driver issues, it has performed flawlessly printing everything from pages to envelopes. Feel free to contact me if you need print driver Version 4.

I've used All-in-ones for almost ten years, sampling a variety of printers from HP, Canon, Brother, etc.  I find this printer excels in a number of areas and fails in only one.Here's my take on it:PROS:1. Print quality is as good as Epson claims.  Whether these prints will actually last four times longer than drugstore prints is still up for grabs -- who has years to check out this claim?  Nevertheless, the text and photos are very nice indeed.2. Although I may never use it again, the coloring book feature is fun.  For families with small children, I'm sure this feature will be appreciated.3. Being able to charge up my mp3 player from the port on the front of the printer is a nice little extra.  Anytime I can avoid powering up the computer for such a small task, I'm happy.  And now I have a quick way to do that.4. I love the bright, easy to read control panel. The menu will easily take you where you need to go, such as a quick check of ink levels (again, without powering up the computer).5. Ink usage appears to be very conservative.  I've gone through a ream of paper without exhausting the standard (not high capacity) black cartridge.6. This printer actually can use recycled paper.  Over the years, I've been limited in my paper to 24 lb paper as 20 recycled paper caused repeated jams with my other printers.  This feature alone will mean a reduction in my paper bills.7. The printer includes an automatic duplexer.  You do have to setup this function on printer preferences, but I enjoy using fewer sheets.8. Included in the box was a single printable dvd.  I tried making a color label, and it looks great.  I'll be buying printable CDs and DVDs just for the pleasure of having nice looking disks.9. The printer itself is good-looking and fits in well with the other equipment on my desk. No reason a printer should be ugly, is there?CONS:The scanner works only through a USB connection to my computer, although you can save a scan to a memory card.  Why is that?  Is there something special about wireless that prevents sending a scan to a computer?UNKNOWN:I have not used the fax because my VOIP phone service does not currently support faxing.Overall, I'm a delighted user.  This is a good printer for a family network.Four stars!UPDATE: November 25, 2009I reinstalled the software, using the software downloaded from Epson.  Voila! Epson Scan now appears on my desktop, and my problem is solved.  If it were possible to change the number of stars, I would now award this printer five stars!UPDATE: December 1, 2009Here's the trick.  You must start the Epson Scan from your computer, rather than from the printer (where you'll be standing when you put the photo on the scanner).  Then you'll be able to receive the scan on your computer and without hitching it up to the printer directly.UPDATE:  September 14, 2010Almost a year has passed since I began using this printer.

It is also true that at the time you print the Photo Paper Plus provides images that are virtually indistinguishable from the more expensive Photo Paper Pro.  I have printed identical images onto both for the purpose of making the comparisons and am highly confident that no one would be able to tell without the most extreme side-by-side comparison.There is, however, one big problem with the Photo Paper Plus.  The images will fade much more quickly than the Photo Paper Pro.  I have had images in a photo album that faded significantly just one year after printing.  The album was kept in a cool, dark place but it made no difference.  The Photo Paper Pro is designed to last for decades under similar conditions, but this paper is not.  Unfortunately, Canon makes 5x7 paper only in Plus... no Pro paper is available.I have taken to using this 5x7 stock solely to generate test prints.  Once I know I have a keeper, I print it onto an 8x10 sheet of Photo Paper Pro and crop away the excess.

470841,A28X0LT2100RL1,B001GIK07I,Eusebius,"[7, 10]","I do many kinds of printing, from photos to brochures to design forms.  When my Canon 5000 finally wore out, I took a chance on this Kodak printer - Kodak is a large, experienced company and should be making a top-notch color printer, right?  Wrong!  This is a 4th class printer being sold as 1st class equipment.Some problems: there is a plastic ""tongue"" that slides out of the front of the printer and is a ""paper catcher.""  It is poorly made and very fragile for its function.  On the second day I had it, I brushed against it and part of it snapped off.  I did a quick repair... imagine, a brand new printer with a duct tape repair!  The plastic body LOOKS solid, but is actually pretty poorly made and unstable.Paper feed is very iffy.  Frequently, when printing multiple copies, it will misfeed and skip paper in the input tray and give you a blank page; this means you have to check EVERY page you print to make sure there are no blank pages in the series.  This is a real problem if you are doing two-sided printing.  Please note that this happens on ALL paper from 24 to 32 lb paper and up to 48 lb card stock. It will NOT print Avery postcards if they have been separated into individual cards - it will only print them 4 at a time on one sheet.  This is a REAL problem if you design graphics -you'll have to replicate the graphics four times on one 8.5x11 form of four cards. Also, if the forms or paper you are using are not standard sizes - you are not going to print them on this printer.  There is little versatility on that count.Plain old black and white document printing is only fair.  Again, printing multiple pages will cause them to bleed onto each other much like the old laser printers of 15 years ago used to do when they heated up.  Frequently the paper will come out almost soaking wet - and take over 10 minutes to dry.Photo printing is so-so.  You'd think Kodak would at least give you this much, but they dont.  Inks are not bright enough and printing multiple copies can cause them to bleed onto each other. Drying time can take 15 minutes or more. This is atrocious for a company that specializes in photo work!The copy function has all the problems of the print functions listed above, so I won't elaborate on them.I am very sorry I bought this printer.  It does not meet my simple needs for graphic work and is a poor b&w; document printer.The only saving grace I had was that the retailer I bought it from allowed me a $50 trade-in on my old Canon printer so I didn't have to pay full retail for this piece of junk.

But I guess I didn't do enough, because it turns out that, even at the lowest setting, it's just a tad too high for my workbench. The description says 20x20x42. But gives no indication what part of the chair is measured at 42 inches. So the description is useless. In any case, I'm here to tell you that at the lowest setting the top of the seat is at 31 inches, and at the highest setting, about 35 1/2 inches. Now why couldn't this company (or any of these chair companies) just say that?2. The instructions are an IQ test. For instance:A) there are two tubes that comprise the vertical supports. They are different sizes, but are given the same part number. So, which one goes below the footrest and which goes above it? You'll get no clue from the instructions, but I'll tell that if you want the footrest to be lower, use the shorter tube for the lower piece (the one that connects with the stand). I found out the hard way, and now my knees are up around my neck! (exaggeration :)B) You will pull all the hair out of your head until you discover that the upper tube (as above) must be pushed far enough through the footrest hole so that the lower tube will ""stick"" to it. If you don't get it right, the chair will wobble. I'd say you should push it through far enough so that the beginning of the taper is about an inch or so beyond (below) the hole.C) There are two parts that you'll think are missing. They aren't. They're just hiding. On the parts list diagram they look like two donut shaped parts about 2 to 3 inches in diameter. You'll be looking all over the place for them; rifling through the packaging, turning the box inside out. Just before you decide to send the chair back, you'll find that, in fact, they are only a little washer and a lock washer that are already in place on the chair-back support arm (they're on the screw/wheel that tightens the support arm to the chair back).D) Once you've assembled the chair it will NEVER, EVER come apart. Believe me, I tried to do it. Because the footrest was too high, I thought I'd just switch the two short tube for the long on. It was like the tubes and hydraulics were welded together. So get it right the first time!!Other than the above peccadilloes, it's a good chair. Sturdy (so far) and nice looking. Refer to number 2 above to help with putting it together, and as far as the height goes, I'd suggest putting some phone books or something on an existing chair to actually demonstrate for yourself how high the chair you buy needs to be.Good luck",3,"Good chair, but sitter beware.",1322438400,"11 28, 2011",486,27,27,1,helpful

Therefore, this is not a comprehensive review of all features one may want to know.I was aware about the limitations of any wand scanner before purchasing the PDSWF-ST44-VP. Also, that shortcomings like no capability of cropping, partial distortions due to unequal scanning speed or uneven surface, undesirable stripes (where the background appears) along the edges should not be rated as diminishing factors as these shortcomings just represent the current &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; of all handheld scanners.However, what was most promising was Vupont&#8217;s description ofa. scanning in color or monochrome mode,b. choice of format, (jpg and pdf)c. three levels of resolution, (300dpi, 600dpi and 900dpi) as well asd. transfer option by USB, microSD or by Wi-Fi available for Windows and Mac OS 10.5+.All four features combined would serve my purpose of1. scanning of more than 90% of documents in monochrome as to keep file sizes at minimum,2. adopting a uniform format of all imaged documents (pdf) as some companies&#8217;  e-mail servers do not allow .jpg to pass,, albeit that work flow and my filing system also prefers a non-editable (or at least  hard-to-edit) format. (pdf)3. choose resolution depending on the importance and quality of the original document, e.g. birth certificate (eternal validity) or a driving license (long term and important) as opposed to a monthly account statement (temporary and replaceable) or invitation to a yearly general meeting of your HOA.(for the records only).4. easy transfer to my MacBook Pro OS 10.6.8 or any smart phone by Wi-Fi. The latter would have the added advantage to let one preview a scan as to decide whether re-scanning is needed or not.

(393 kb with resolution 300dpi, 885kb with resolution 600dpi and 2MB in resolution 900dpi)My flat-bed HP scanner produced 395 kb in color and only 40 kb in monochrome, both with resolution 300dpi of the very same page.Supposedly, one has to send ten different documents by e-mail (e.g. an insurance claim with bills and prescriptions, etc.) the attachments would amount to 10 x 393kb = 3.93mb compared with my flat-bed scans of 10 x 40kb = 400kb = 0.4mb only. (Difference: 3.93 &#8211; 0.4 = 3.53mb or roughly 10-fold = 1000% !!!) The same volume would be needed on one&#8217;s storage media such as on a HD. Nowadays SSD&#8217;s do not offer generous storage capacities yet and are expensive too. Every kb costs money.  (Even though one probably would zip the files as to save up to 20% of file sizes. Yet it cannot compensate for the 1000% oversized files.)Findings A: Monochrome scanning does not mean smaller file-sizes than those of color scans unlike other scanning software. Therefore, the use of the wand scanner for documents is limited to less than 10% of my cases when a color image is desirable. However, most of them are not produced in field but rather at home or the office where flat bed scanners are in abundance.B. Jpg vs. pdf format of documents: Here again I experienced that file sizes of scanned documents in both formats are almost identical. Jpg easily can be reduced but quality, i.e legibility may suffer, albeit it&#8217;s too much work.Findings B: PDF does not offer smaller file sizes than jpg. On Mac one can reduce pdf file sizes though by using the quartz filter of the Preview, but this would mean again additional work for every scan again and again.C. Resolution higher than 300dpi: It&#8217;s nice to have 900dpi for scanning eternal and low quality original documents like birth or old marriage certificates. However, for such delicate archiving most people would use a flat bed scanner anyway. The use of scanning documents with higher resolution seems to be limited to scan old book pages in libraries or in preparation of a court case at lawyers&#8217; office or at similar odd occasion.Findings C: Higher than 300dpi resolution is hardly ever useful for scanning documents. It&#8217;s however absolute necessary for photographs, evaluation of which is however done by other reviewers.D. Transfer data: While transferring files by USB connection or inserting the microSD card to a notebook is flawless, (didn&#8217;t try to insert the microSD to my phone) the Wi-Fi connection simply cannot be set-up on my Mac. E-mails to Vupoint remained futile, (best advice: &#8220;change the batteries&#8221; whereby it was clearly a software problem, ha, ha, ha) and no reply to my very elaborated step-by-step inquiry after 8 days. So is their hotline too. (1-888-788-6888) The lady said I should not try my Mac but a Windows pc instead, which I did.  I was able to open the &#8220;MAGICWAND&#8221; network after inserting the default password 123456789 into the pop-up window and keying the IP 192.168.1.2 into the browser&#8217;s address field. (It also worked when inserting &#8220;magic.wand&#8221;) I was able to see and download the scanned files. Vupoint&#8217;s label about system requirements: Mac OS 10.4+ is however misleading. As the hotline said, do not use your Mac. Very disappointing if that&#8217;s true. The ABBY OCR software is not compatible with Mac and is stated on the website too. Why do they not label the Wi-Fi in a similar fashion? Unless I missed something and the customer service is ignoring it.Findings D: The Wi-Fi does not work with Mac.Final conclusions:I. I have returned this scanner to amazon today.Reasons:- cannot scan monochrome documents with small file sizes- Wi-Fi doesn&#8217;t work with Mac. (One star has been knocked out.)- the use is limited to very rare occasion when color scans of documents are desirable ad hoc and no other scanner is available.- It&#8217;s like keeping a spare wheel in one&#8217;s car. One may not need it for years, but once it is needed it can save a lot of trouble. And it must have proper air pressure at that point too, just like the charge of the battery for the scanner! Flat tire, no drive, low bat, no scans. Does one has to carry a battery charger as well when traveling? AA size batteries  used to be available all over the world.II. I have ordered the Vupoint PDS-ST441-VP today. (No Wi-Fi but with colored reviewing display. It is intended to be my &#8220;spare wheel&#8221;, just in case. By doing so I disregarded the not-so-helpful customer service of  Vupoint, (for which reason another star has been knocked out) since the device is easy to operate and seems to be reasonably made. The clip-in tiny plastic tongs of the battery cover may not survive too many changes of the batteries though. I will either not snap it in but rather use a tape around or I wait till get broken and I still can resort to taping it.III. As I am mainly focused on scanning documents (paperless office and keeping only absolute necessary papers at home) while also being a Mac user, (not a devoted follower) this review may only address a small faction of would-be buyers. However I just wanted to provide some useful hints  for those few.",3,"WiFi not for Mac. Also, watch file sizes",1358812800,"01 22, 2013",1270,60,64,0.9375,helpful

171979,A2ITY3O2UPJLN8,B000935SDC,J. Alec West,"[15, 17]","As a former Vonage customer (for a year-and-a-half), I must say that I am mightily impressed with the service I now receive from Packet8. As soon as I received my Adapter 410 device from Amazon.com, I opened the box, read the short instruction card, and was talking VoIP in under 10 minutes.I live on the West Coast (Portland, OR) and began making a number of local calls and calls to Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and one call to Halifax, Nova Scotia (Canada). Each call had, to the best of my perception, identical quality ... and the quality was nothing short of superb.On the billing end of things, they told me there'd be no activation fee and my first month was free. In actual fact, however, I'll end up getting close to 45 days free since customers signing up in mid-month are apparently given the ""benefit of the doubt"" on this issue. I called up their customer service department to make sure (3 minute wait only). Mind you, I only mean free of Packet8 charges. Until my first paid billing period starts on February 3rd next year, I still have to pay the $1.50 monthly regulatory recovery fee (Federal) and starting in January, a monthly $1.99 fee for e911. So, assuming my math is correct, this will be the makeup of my first normal bill from Packet8 - and subsequent bills that do not include calls outside the US/Canada:$19.99 - Packet8, unlimited US/Canada calls__1.50 - regulatory recovery fee__1.99 - e911 fee___.60 - Federal Excise Tax======$24.08 - total monthly cost of planI suspect Vonage's ""total monthly cost"" has gone up since I left them in July ... but compare that with Vonage's $27.24 ""total monthly cost"" I paid before I left them. Vonage does have one benefit over Packet8, though. You can call numbers in Puerto Rico free. With Packet8, I'd have to pay 3-4 cents a minute for such a call (assuming I knew someone in Puerto Rico to call, hehe).There is one complaint I have about Packet8, though ... but it's kind of a funny complaint. When I called up their customer service department, I was appalled at the quality of the call. The automated menu voice wavered in and out and I thought the call might drop. But, when I hung up and dialed them up again, I noticed that the wavering was consistently in the same places. In short, it was not a ""call"" quality issue. They just have lousy automated-voice menus that need to be re-recorded, hehehe. When the human customer service rep answered (3 minute wait), the wavering magically went away. Every other call I've since made from my Packet8 phone has been fantastic and, at this point, I have no complaints whatsoever.Some closing comments. For VoIP to work properly, you must have a true ""high-speed"" connection. I have 3-megabit broadband. If you have a more marginal broadband connection (like most DSL providers give you), your results may vary. The slower a connection speed is, the more 'artifacts' you'll hear. In short, don't blame Packet8 because you've chosen a cheap broadband provider. Electrical (radio, TV, computer, etc.) interference near your modem or router could be another culprit causing marginal quality. Again, a personal issue, not a Packet8 issue. Finally, I've seen a number of complaints regarding the porting of an existing number to Packet8 ... that it takes a long time. Again, this is not a Packet8 issue. While competing phone companies are required to surrender an existing number to a competitor when asked, they take their own sweet time about it. I suspect they're hoping users will blame the NEW provider for the delay and throw up their hands in frustration, choosing to stay with their CURRENT provider. In fact, delays in porting an existing number to a new service are largely the fault of the CURRENT provider, not the NEW provider.Solution? Dump your old number and get a new one. Problem solved. In the future, I hope the FCC will address the issue and impose a porting ""deadline"" on providers. Complaints on porting time delays are inherent with many providers, not just Packet8. And, like I suggested, customers blaming the ""accepting"" service provider for the delay are blaming the WRONG provider in most cases. It's basic consumer logic. Who is more likely to give you the worst customer service ... a new provider eager to have your business ... or an old provider you're abandoning? Think about this.P.S. One thing you may notice. All VoIP calls are routed through hubs. Vonage's hub is in New Jersey so caller-ID stamps are Eastern time. Packet8's hub is in California so caller-ID stamps are Pacific time. This can also create some confusion with people who dial ""region-based"" toll-free numbers. Example.I occasionally call into the Coast-to-Coast AM radio show, originally done by Art Bell. They have two toll-free lines. One is designated for callers East of the Rockies, another for callers West of the Rockies. When I was with Vonage, and even though I live in Oregon, I could only call in on the ""East"" of the Rockies line (because Vonage's hub is in New Jersey). But now I'm with Packet8, I can call in using the proper line.If you normally dial ""region-based"" toll-free numbers as a matter of business, you'll probably have to start dialing a non toll-free number (which is free with Vonage or Packet8 anyway) if your provider's hub is located outside the region specified by the business's phone.BTW, if you're wondering why I left Vonage, it was because I was paying (in part) for 911 service I was NOT getting ... and found out I wasn't alone. Three state attorneys general, so far, have filed deceptive marketing practices suits against Vonage for 911 ""irregularities"" (Texas, Michigan, Connecticut). And, I waited until after the November 30th FCC deadline mandating e911 coverage to start shopping around for a new provider. Packet8 is e911 compatible.One final cautionary note. If you have a power failure or if your broadband ISP has a service interruption, your VoIP phone will not work. This can be dangerous if you need to make a 911 call during such a time. The solution is to buy a $19.99 Nokia 1100 TracFone which comes with 20 minutes of airtime (through TracFone.com or at local Target and WalMart stores). Just keep it charged up and, if you NEED to make a call during downtimes, you can. Also, keep this in mind. Once, I had a power failure but needed to make a call. I went next door to my neighbor to use her landline phone - but it was out, too. The same falling tree limb that cut our power also cut her phone line. So, I recommend ALL users of landline or VoIP phones to have this cheap alternative handy. Between the time I dumped Vonage and enabled Packet8, it was my only telephone. And, I still use it as an emergency backup phone on the rare occasion it's needed.",5,"So far, so good!!!",1135814400,"12 29, 2005",1167,15,17,0.882352941,helpful

It offers a somewhat business look for a lot less money than a high-end business telephone.  I received the product quite quickly and had the phone setup and configured in roughly 10 minutes.  Installing the batteries wasn't as easy as one may like but I figured I should only have to change them about once per year anyway.  The phone is quite light and has a very plastic feel to the main unit.  However, the receiver feels quite solid and the incoming sound of the phone is very good.  I do notice a slight echo of my own voice, in the receiver, when talking on this phone.  It's nothing too distracting though.  The backlit display is a great idea and once of the reasons why I chose this telephone.  I have to admit that I am a bit dissapointed with the display though.  The backlighting tends to wash out the LCD data on the display, especially if you are looking at the display from a slight distance or from an angle.  The speakerphone produces good sound at an adequate volume but could stand to be a bit louder.  My biggest complaint, other than the washed out LCD display, is that the number buttons don't always seem to activate the tone if pushed lightly.  I have to concentrate on pushing the buttons firmly in order to get all of the digits entered properly.  This is sometimes a frustration when entering in digits for an automated telecom system, such as retrieving messages from a voicemail system or accessing an automated response system over the phone.  I have gotten used to it though and it seems like less of a problem the longer I have this phone.  I did accidentally hang up on someone once, even though I had pushed the hold button.  That button also requires a slow, firm push to engage at times.  I have learned to wait for the little red LED light up, indicating that the hold feature is active, before I hand up the receiver.  Overall I am quite pleased with this unit as a desktop phone.  Sure there are some minor quirks but the main functionality of this devices is quite sound.  It has great looks, very good sound quality, and a host of features that are typically found on telephones of higher cost.  I have noticed a fairly wide price range for this particular model so it pays to shop around on-line.  I nearly bought it from a place that was charging $12.00 more for it (plus shipping).

Once the included HP toner cartridges ran out (which was soon because the cartridges that come with the printer are intentionally low-volume), we decided to try to save some money over the real HP cartridges by purchasing these. In the end, it didn't work out well.When we first put the cartridges in, I noticed that the print quality was only very slightly worse than with the real HP cartridges (blacks were not quite as black, and I got the impression that colors were slightly muted by comparison). If the quality had remained the same and the total volume of toner was comparable to the HP cartridges, however, I would've recommended them to anyone doing casual printing (vs. printing professional graphics or anything that's supposed to look really nice). Unfortunately, about two months after we first put them in, we are now experiencing major problems. First, pages come out with semi-random black stripes on them. This even happens right after the printer has finished cleaning itself and ranges from mildly annoying to very frustrating (it has resulted in many documents that were virtually unreadable). Second, a strange blue powder has developed on the bottom of each of the four toner cartridges (at first I thought it was cyan toner, but it comes out of every cartridge so I don't think that's the case). This blue powder has ended up all over the inside of the printer, the table beneath the printer, and on the sides of many printed pages.Pros:-cheaper than HP ink-works pretty well at firstCons:-terrible printing quality from at least one of the cartridges (black) after two months of light-to-moderate use-mysterious blue powder spilling out of all four cartridges (see update below)Note:-even if you manage to maintain decent print quality from these cartridges, the total volume of toner would have to be high enough to warrant buying these over the HP cartridges (and I don't know how you would test this without spending $200+), so that's something to keep in mindIn summary, I would recommend against buying these cartridges. As expensive as the real HP cartridges are, it's probably worth getting them instead in the long run.Update (2-22-2011): Upon closer inspection, maybe the mysterious blue powder is cyan toner after all? Either way, it's all over everything, which can't be a good sign.Update (2-24-2011): We replaced the generic black cartridge with a real HP cartridge, and all our black-ink printing problems (see above) immediately went away--more evidence that these cartridges are of poor quality.Update (4-9-2011): Cyan toner continues to get on everything, and the yellow and magenta cartridges have started to leave random stripes on printed pages as of a few weeks ago; if there was any doubt before, these cartridges are definitely not worth buying now.",1,Lower price not worth the hassle,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",487,37,37,1,helpful

Let me put it this way, if you want anything other than a low end copy machine, buy something else. My first inkling that this heap of shoddy manufactured plastic wasn't worth the money was the annoying groaning sound it made each time a computer ""requested"" that something be printed. Usually you just hear the paper feed and then the printout makes its way to the output tray. Not the Artisan 837! First, you get a loud groaning sound resembling a muted fugle horn for 3 seconds. Then, the printer tries to get a sheet of paper from the paper tray. Good luck with that step.  I can't tell you how many ""false starts"" I've had where I go to print, the groaning sound reverberates off the office walls, and then I hear the paper feed try to get the paper, only to fail miserably and quit 2 seconds later with an error about how there is a paper jam.  I've tried everything but a complete disassembly of the unit to clear every orifice, but nothing seems to work.  Apparently, it is incapable of a good paper feed. Last night and this morning, I worked for over an hour to get a single sheet of paper to print out, and I was unable to accomplish this task.  At the other end of the spectrum, there have been times when I've gone to print and the paper feed has grabbed 3 sheets of paper and printed the single page of text across all 3 sheets.Frankly, I don't have time for this nonsense. When I click ""print"", I want the GD printer to print. I can't worry about whether or not I've bought the exact right ""Extra Glossy Ink Jet Mid-Weight Epson Paper"". I'm going to Office Depot or CVS and I'm grabbing a ream of ink jet printer paper and by golly I expect that should work.For all these folks out here who are printing pictures - have fun. Does anyone really print 4x6 photos anymore? With email, web posting, and personal phones and tablets, it's hard to imagine that anyone pumps out a hard copy, but I guess they still sell buggy whips and oxen cart yokes somewhere.In summary - If you want to be frustrated and waste hours of your time fussing with a printer, the ARTISAN 837 is the time-waster for you!

Setup was fairly easy once I downloaded the latest Windows 2000 drivers from Nikon's US website (you have to dig around their convoluted site to find it). The Nikon Scan software contains all the basic controls to allow you to adjust levels to your satisfaction. The CleanImage feature is amazing! If you have any scratches, smudges, or other such blemishes on your film, the CleanImage function will get rid of them 9 times out of 10. At the highest settings (12 bit) the scans from my slides come out wonderful, and the resulting files are large (around 50MB) but great for archiving your slides digitally. The Nikon Scan software does so much that you don't have to open up Photoshop unless you really want to tinker with the photo for use on the web or with other artwork.Now for the negatives. The documentation is not very thorough. If you want to learn the ins and outs of every function and menu of the Nikon Scan software, you'll have to consult the websites of some powerusers. The slide feeder, which I also bought, is a bit clumsy. I haven't had any huge problems with it yet, but its construction certainly doesn't inspire a lot of faith. Also, you have to sit their and use the software to advance to the next slide, so it isn't as automated as you think. You can't pop 50 slides in, adjust all the settings, and come back the next day to fifty completed scans. And finally, as others have noted, Nikon's tech support is extremely weak.All in all, I think this is a great scanner for the serious photographer who wants to generate high quality scans without spending a fortune on drum scans. Those who just wish to get usable scans to post on web pages should go with a lower cost scanner or have their local photo shop transfer their photos to a Kodak Photo CD.",4,"Makes outstanding scans, though slide feeder is clunky",973555200,"11 7, 2000",349,81,82,0.987804878,helpful

I am using it at home, and I can hear it down the hall, so if that's too loud...4) In order to FULLY open the lid (to the glass), you will need at least 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) in clearance behind the machine.  So, shoving this all the way against a wall is not recommended.5) Paper jams.  Had a few that took a good long while to figure out.  There's a little gray door on the back that you will become intimately familiar with -- it's the key to most printing jams (that happen quite frequently.)6) The quality of the scan is great!

I purchased the HP 150 for use during a move - I needed a much small and portable printer as my HP 8500 is large and heavy. I have previously owned the HP 100 (no scanner) when on a six month assignment to San Diego, but decided to pop for the higher price and capabilities of the HP 150 this time.As a portable printer, it performed flawlessly. There are obvious limitations to a portable printer. For example: it can only hold limited amounts of paper in the feed. Two-sided printing must be manually flipped. There is no tray to catch the printed sheets. Ink cartridges are smaller than a full-size printer. Regardless of the limitations, I was able to do everything I needed.The scanner function works well. The included software allows you to create scanning templates. For example: Template for high quality color, or low-res black & white, etc. The limitations are that the scanner really only likes standard width paper. The paper guide slider does not offer enough variety to hold narrow items (such as a photo) in a firm position while going through the scanner. Thus, the item shifts on the rollers and ends up being a skewed image. In short - you will never get the same quality from a roller based scanner as you would from a flat-bed scanner.I scanned an entire bankers box of documents with very few errors. The scanner is SLOW, but considering it is a portable consumer product (not a desktop business device) it is an acceptable speed.As for the touch-screen... I seldom needed to use any of it's functions. Could the same information be presented in a widget on your computer screen? Perhaps. As other reviews have suggested, the touch screen could be the cause for the inflated price of this model.When closed up or in the open position, the printer is attractive but not distractive. No sharp edges or ugliness. The lid and paper eject door seem sturdy enough, but as moveable components could be the first items to be broken if careless.I did not print with Bluetooth connection, so cannot comment on that. The battery life seems acceptable. Just turn the printer off between printings and it last a long time.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I did not experience any jams or failures to print.

As I stated in the first review, I returned the SPP-A973 because caller ID did not perform properly.  I assumed that this was just bad luck and that the next phone would perform as expected.  I was wrong.  There is something wrong  with Sony's caller ID system.  Specifically, I found that if I received a  phone call, Sony's caller ID would *sometimes* show the call as a new call.  But, typically, the call was erroneously included as 'old'.  Sometimes,  caller ID would not record the call at all.  The day I returned the phone,  a friend of mine left a recorded message.  The message indicator performed  as expected (a blinking numerical light) but the caller ID light did not  activate.  And, as I scrolled the recorded caller ID calls, that particular  phone call was included in the old phone call list.I tried two phones  and each exhibited the same characteristics.  Calls to Sony's customer  support shed no light on the problem. I traded the Sony for the Uniden EXAI  8985.  Caller ID works perfectly on this phone.  Given my experience with the SPP-A973, I can't recommend it.  I would be  interested in comments from others who have reviewed the phone and whether  my observations regarding caller ID can be confirmed.  In my view the  Panasonic (which I described in a previous review) is the phone to  purchase.",1,Sony SPP-A973 Revisited,945561600,"12 19, 1999",238,11,12,0.916666667,helpful

783279,A95C90945WO37,B00450DVDY,mykehorn,"[10, 10]","Having owned and suffered several inkjets in the past, I have always admired the speed and quality of laser printers... but the much higher cost had kept me out of that market until now. In early 2011 I installed my first home wireless 802.11n network and on a lark I decided to research laser printers. I was surprised to find that several budget models with wi-fi capability were actually very reasonable and quite within my price range ($100-150).At the time of my comparison, 3 serious contenders stood out. Obviously theBrother Printer HL2270DW Wireless Monochrome Printer, theSamsung ML-2525W Wireless Mono Laser Printer, and theHP LaserJet Pro P1102w Printer (CE657A#BGJ). They were all very similar so after reading review after negative review (I usually start with the 1 star ratings and work my way up), I took a leap of faith and selected the Brother - due, it seems, that it was the lesser of 3 evils. Though I didn't end up purchasing from Amazon, I am very happy that I received the printer and starter toner/drum assembly for under a hundred and ten bucks.As an advanced User, I didn't think the installation would be anything more than I could handle - and it pretty much went as smoothly as expected. I knew what to expect and I was well prepared for common setup problems due to the reviews I had read prior to ordering. The printer was up and running on 802.11g wi-fi (mixed WinXP/Win7/Android network) in less than half a day's work. Oh, and that includes downloading the newest drivers and even the upgrading the device to the most recent firmware for the print and network hardware.I followed advice from several savvy reviewers which bears repeating, so if you haven't installed yet or are having trouble your best bet is to run the setup program with the device hard-wired through ethernet (to your gateway or router) rather than USB. Also, you are advised to configure the printer with a static IP address. It's easier than it sounds, just have the printer use an IP address outside of your normal DHCP range (e.g. someone with a dynamic range of 192.168.0.100 through 192.168.0.150 might set their printer to use 192.168.0.69). This is all configured through Brother's setup program, you should not actually have to login to your router unless you do not have DHCP service (in which case you should probably contact your Network Administrator). Finally, or more importantly firstly, you should visit Brother's website and download the latest software drivers... and if you feel competent, the firmware drivers and instructions. If you installed your own network, this should be cake and pie.If you are a confident User and you are in the market for a casual laser printer, you should be very happy with this purchase. The wi-fi capability for me was a requirement, but the auto-duplex feature is definitely a nice bonus over the manual duplexing currently found in other models of this class. I can't speak to the cost per page or ability to print large volumes of paper; but for a low cost wireless laser with crisp text, large paper capacity, and multiple toner replacement options - the Brother HL2270DW absolutely ranks at the top.A more intuitive error reporting system (such as a display on the printer) might be the only improvement. LCDs are cheap and seem to be put on everything these days... it's almost anachronistic to diagnose common printer issues using columns of analog LEDs on an otherwise advanced 21st century device.",5,"If the horror stories don't scare you away, this is definitely a printer to consider",1307664000,"06 10, 2011",586,10,10,1,helpful
533541,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B001V9LQH0,Scott,"[46, 47]","Note - This scanner is the next generation of theFujitsu ScanSnap S500 Clr 18PPM/36IPM Dupl ScannerOur office has dozens of HP Scanjets and Xerox Documates and, as the IT guy, I hate every one. Feeders wear out, get jammed, pull multiple pages through, and are slow. I decided to go with the Fujistu ScanSnap because of all the great reviews, despite the higher price. Our budget doesn't allow for a copier scanner or a high priced workstation scanner. For the price, the ScanSnap is excellent.1. This scanner is very small. It is only slightly wider than a letter-sized sheet of paper, and when everything is folded up, it is half as long. Unlike other scanners, I can easily find room for it at any desk in our office. It is so small it could even sit on top of a workstation.2. This scanner is VERY easy to use. Previous scanners had buttons all over them for different functions. You would press the regular scan button, and then have to wait for the scanner's software to start up, the lamp to warm up, the image to preview (I HATE previewing the image!), and the slow process of scanning. The Fujitsu ScanSnap has two buttons. A power button (which I never use since I leave the unit on all the time) and a big green SCAN button. Put the paper in, press the button, and literally within about 5 seconds it scans the image, and in another 3 or 4 it converts it to PDF and saves it. It is amazing how insanely fast this scanner is.3. The Software provided by Fujitsu is great. It is very unobtrusive and easy to use. I scan most of my docs to PDF, so after it is done scanning, I just use their included software, which shows previews of the actual scans. I can click an ""e-mail"" button and 2 seconds later it opens my email program with the scan already attached. MUCH faster than scanning directly from Acrobat. It's also great that I can use their software standalone and don't have to deal with Acrobat at all, which is incredibly bloated in version 7.It comes with some other software, such as an OCR reader which I haven't tried, and a program called CardMinder which you can use to scan in business cards. It will scan the card, use the OCR reader to categorize the contact information, as well as save an actual image of the card. I don't use this program either but it definitely seems useful for people who receive a lot of cards. It also comes with Acrobat Standard 7.0 so you don't have to buy Adobe's software.This might be the best piece of office equipment I've purchased. If you are looking for a powerful scanner at a mid-range price it is great, and I definitely recommend it for anyone who does a lot of scanning to PDF. It is worth the extra $250 or so compared to the HP scanners simply for the copy of Acrobat and the speed of use.The differences between the S1500 and its predecessor, theFujitsu ScanSnap S500 Clr 18PPM/36IPM Dupl Scanner, are:1. The S1500 is slightly faster at scanning, and the software seems to be a little faster at processing the documents.  Given that the S500 was fast to begin with, the increase is barely noticeable.2. Form factor - The S1500 has straighter lines and looks more modern while the S500 is a little more rounded.  The differences are pretty dramatic and I probably prefer the S1500 more.3. The S1500 comes bundled with a newer version of ScanSnap Manager.  That's somewhat significant because it is pretty difficult to obtain the software/drivers if you don't have the disc it came with. You can't just go on Fujitsu's site and download it, you have to actually contact them and give them your model number, and then they give you an FTP site to obtain the software. So don't lose your discs.  It also comes with Acrobat Standard 9.  The Acrobat software is terrible, but it is a little better than the Acrobat Standard 8 that comes bundled with the S500.Overall, I do think they improved a bit on the S500, but not enough where anyone needs to replace their S500 with the S1500.",5,Another great scanner by Fujitsu,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",714,46,47,0.978723404,helpful

As I've never owned a color laser, I was surprised to find out that if you print in either AUTO or COLOR mode, and the document (not the page - the document) has a single spot of color, all the black text will be printed by layering the colors rather than using the black toner.  If you look closely, you can see it.So, set the printer to monochrome mode by default and only turn color on when you need it.It's still annoying with the 150 page document that has a color image that I need in color every 4-5 pages.  If I print it in color mode, all the black text gets printed in color.  If I print it in monochrome mode, I don't get color images where I need them.  The solution is to print only the pages you need in color and the rest in monochrome, but that's a gigantic pain in the butt on a large document.It's still a nice printer, and it may have been a quirk of the PDFs I were printing rather than the printer (I really don't know) but from what I've seen, that might be the case with this printer.

202385,ABVYGB2TKBO8F,B000E60HJO,"J. Donaldson ""Cal-diver""","[36, 37]","1) Why I bought what I boughtWe had a 900MHz cordless Panasonic with voice recorder for about 8 years. We also have had a very simple 900MHz Sony cordless for about 12 years. Both actually worked well but each had issues.The Panasonic had to be disassembled every three months so we could clean the keypad contacts with alcohol as they had some kind of oily liquid that interfered with the contact. The Panasonic also had a bit of a strange user interface. For example one had to click down then right on the ""joystick"" button to select the directory before selecting a name to dial. The handset operation of the voice recorder was so cryptic that we always used the base.The Sony worked quite well except the listening volume, with only two settings, was too low so we only used that phone to answer when in the bedroom. If we had to make a call we would use the Panasonic so we would have good volume.My sister recently bought a Uniden TRU9485-2 and loves it so I started doing some research. I checked Amazon user comments on a lot of cordless phones, including a number of Uniden models, and it was clear that this particular model had the highest user rating so I dug in to learn more. Then made the decision to buy.Amazon's free shipping is something I always pay attention to and wanted to take advantage of it this time. Strange though that the TRU9485-2 (indicating TWO handsets) is not sold and shipped by Amazon. However the TRU9485 with one handset IS sold and shipped by Amazon as is the TRU9485-3 with three handsets. So I bought a TRU9485 plus an extra handset TCX905 and the total of the two was just $3 more than this two handset model but with free shipping! I even called Amazon about the strange situation that they don't sell and ship the two handset model but they could only give me a standard answer.I also bought a TWX977 waterproof, floating handset which I will review.2) My observationsFirst I really like to read the least flattering comments of users to see what they don't like. Two things stood out. 1) The range isn't as good as they hoped. 2) The volume isn't loud enough (a big concern for me as our Sony is almost useless because of low listening volume). So the first thing I checked was the range and volume.We live in a standard California tract home of somthing less than 1/4 acre. I walked the phone to every corner of our lot including to the far corner of the garage which has a tent trailer and boat so there is pleanty of metal to block a signal. The phones performed flawlessly to the extend of my property.The volume is adequate on the earpiece, and loud on the speakerphone in the handset. On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is silent, 10 is too loud and 8 is what I would hope for, I would rate the volume a 6-7. It is fine in a normal home noise environment but if there were more noise it may be hard to hear. Not bad enough to send it back though. The sound quality is tip-top.Features: When I read through the feature set before the purchase I thought it was a bit overloaded, but you can always ignore features you don't need. The thing that impresses me is how good the user interface is which makes all of the features pretty easy to use. My wife is not a techno person but in this case I think she will use the handset to listen to voice messages because it is very straight forward. There is even a vocal help message available on the handset to walk you through the keys required to operate the voice recorder from the handset. Cool. The orange backlight display and keypad add to the ease of use.One feature that doesn't seem too useful for us is the phone-to-phone DirectLink option. You must first negotiate with both people holding the handsets that you will go into DirectLink mode before you can use this feature. It just seemed like the intercom would be much more useful. So we will simply ignore that feature.The speakerphone in the handsets is very functional and already has been used and useful. I was on a 1/2 hour call this morning (just got the phones last night) and was able to switch to speakerphone so I could accomplish a couple of small tasks while listening, then switched back to the regular mode. The speakerphone is clear and loud; very handy to have it on every handset. I also tried the headset from my Panasonic and it worked perfectly on the Uniden.The backlighted handset keys have a nice sold feel. The layout of the soft keys at the top, and the 4 way rocker switch is logical. The base keys are also backlight and have a logical layout.Programming the handset phone book is easy, and you can transfer the phone book entries to the other phones either by transfering ALL or the SELECTED number. However it does not transfer the speed dial settings. Also if you enter JACK CELL and transfer it then decide to rename it to just JACK and transfer it to another handset you'll see the second handset now has two entries one named JACK CELL and the other just JACK. It apparently matches up the name and isn't smart enough to delete the old one and replace it with the new one. These handset-to-handset copy irritations could have been done better but certainly not enough to reject the set. I suppose some would find the ability to have different setups on each handset to be a positive feature. For our house it seems best if every phone works exactly the same way. A ""Copy Exact"" feature would have been nice.We also purchased the TWX977 waterproof, floating handset for use outside by the pool and spa. I will keep this one in the garage so I can use it with dirty or wet hands, then move to the back yard when needed. We filled the sink and sure enough it floats. It has all the same features as the other handsets except it does not have a headset phone jack. It's built quite well, looks and feels sturdy, floats and can go to 9 foot depth so will be safe around our 8' deep pool. I have a Uniden VHF radio for my Personal Watercraft and the VHF has had a lot of salt water baths and it is still working fine so I think Uniden knows how to design waterproof equipment.My wife and I were on a 1/2 hour conference call this morning, each with a handset so we could roam the house independently. We were able to be in the same room for the first time because the conversation was ""in sync."" Previously we used the Sony and Panasonic and there was a noticable delay between the two phones so if we were in the same room it was like hearing double when my wife was speaking - one voice direct from her mouth and the second delayed voice coming through the phone.All in all I am very pleased with this Uniden TRU9485. Oh yea it looks better than our older phones, and not having an antenna sticking out helps too. I put the belt clip on all three phones and it helps when I jam the phone between my cheek and shoulder for a few moments to have both hands free.I'm glad my sister recommended this phone. If you are looking at Uniden models this one seems to have a higher user acceptance than the other Uniden models so don't apply my comments to any other than the TRU9485.",5,Finally it's my turn to comment on this phone set!

Shaver ""orangekrona""","[13, 13]","I bought this to replace a ""flavor-of-the-week"" cheapie shredder that cost $30.My old shredder died a while ago, and I had accumulated a stockpile of documents, receipts, etc, to be shredded.  I had shopped around and Amazon was the best price I could find on the Fellowes PS60C-2.  I was very excited when it arrived.  I fed letter-sized papers and credit card offers in, no problem at all.  And the machine was SO QUIET it was hard to believe.As I got further into my pile, there were some credit card offers (still unopened) that were ridiculously thick that stuck halfway through the shred (which in hindsight probably would have counted as 14 pages, twice the sheet limit, since they were folded over).HOWEVER, I pushed the reverse button and got the remainder of the mangled offer out without a problem.  I was pleasantly surprised, since reverse on my old shredder just made things worse, and I had to yank whatever it was out and then pull it out of the teeth.  I checked the teeth on the Fellowes and they were fine.  Onward with the shredding.To get a better feel for its limitations, I opened up another credit card offer and counted 4 separate pieces, but each one was folded over 3 or 4 times.  So, all tolled, and including envelope, there were about 10 pages, which the shredder handled just fine.  I've found that any letter you'd need two stamps to mail should be opened and unfolded before shredding.As for other media, my old shredder used to have to ""think"" about shredding credit cards.  This one snaps them like twigs.I have not yet fed it any paper-clips, but it handles staples with ease.  I wouldn't try a CD, but the PS60C-2 doesn't make any claim that it can shred CDs.I chose this cross-cut shredder because it's a more secure shred, even though I could have gotten a higher sheet limit with just a straight-cut shredder.The bottom line: If you don't mind having to open and unfold an occasional credit card offer, this is a great choice.  But if you want everything to go straight from the mailbox to confetti, you'll need a more robust model.",4,Good shredder; it's easy to get carried away,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",365,13,13,1,helpful

Assembly was pretty easy, and not time consuming.The negative. As other reviewers have noted, this chair is not generic for most people, it is made for BIG(like me) people. If you are under six feet tall, buy a different chair. The arm rests are not flat, they are concave. This means if you are sitting at the computer, working, your armrest has to be pointed directly at the mouse, or you're arm will move out of the groove, then start rubbing against the edge, and start hurting. I fixed this by wrapping a very thick foam pad around the right armrest, which worked, but looks incredibly tacky. The seat is very hard. To solve this problem, I placed a two inch piece of foam on the seat. That didn't work because now, even fully extended, the armrests are too low, and the back support is in the wrong place. Using a one inch piece of foam was a good compromise, as now the back support and armrests work, and my butt is only slightly sore.Two month update: After sitting in this chair for close to two hundred hours, my rear no longer aches, but the armrest still causes my arm to hurt, even with the pad. I guess I'm going to have to make a custom made armrest cover. I also notice, from time to time, the seat drops slightly after sitting in it for several hours. Not a lot, but that worries me that the hydraulics are not top drawer.Final notes: If I had to do it over again, I would sit in any chair I was going to buy first, then go online and read any reviews I could find, and if I was still impressed, buy it where ever it was the cheapest.",3,Mixed feelings...,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",309,14,15,0.933333333,helpful

But most of the technology is in the print head cartridges and the business model of the makers is to sell as many of those as possible. Low cost printers like this one from Epson are viewed by their manufacturers as a loss leader whose main purpose is to addict you to buying their cartridges. To do this, they basically give away the printer. This Epson Stylus NX415 sells on Amazon for $69 including a full set of four colored ink cartridges. But when time comes to reload the cartridges - which will be sooner than you think - the replacement set costs $48! This is as if you bought some cool very low cost car for only $2,000 but then discovered it requires special fuel which costs $1,400 per tank!Since the print cartridges are the real core of the function, you may ask what does it matter which printer you buy? It matters because the printer unit is what aligns everything to perfection and transports the media precisely - the mechanical stuff. Of course mechanical precision and robustness is exactly what you don't get with a very cheap printer. Since, exclusive of the cartridges, this entire printer with its internal computer, LCD and motors, and free shipping is being sold in effect for about ten bucks, you will not be surprised that it is constructed from very flimsy bits of plastic. Plastic gears, etc. It's not designed as a workhorse. Epson is subsidizing this to get you hooked on consumables, not unlike a cellphone contract. This is also why Epson engineers a few tricks into the mechanism to make sure you keep buying their own cartridges. Once you've removed an ink cartridge for example, it cannot be reinserted. The sole reason for this is to keep you from committing the sin of refilling the cartridge with third-party ink. Also, the printer is programmed to stop operating if any one of the four cartridges is low; you are not allowed to make your own decision whether to continue with black-only use for documents for example.I don't know about you, but I find these marketing manipulations a bit offensive. The low initial price of the printer is misleading. Serious users of inkjet photos would be better off buying a better quality and more durable model. Over time, its higher cost is overshadowed by the cost of the ink anyway. Not only ink but high end photo paper is expensive; about a dollar per 8  x 11 sheet. Taking into account that you may print a photo more than once to get it perfect, this is is not a cheap process. Better equipment saves paper from do-overs.An inexpensive all-in-one inkjet like this is intended for households whose workload and usage are light. Also, inkjets - any inkjets - can't be left to sit unused for months, or the nozzles will clog up. So you must use it just the right amount, not too much but not too little. This is inconvenient and most people who do lots of printing don't use inkjets at all. For routine daily text document printing, a small laser printer is a better choice. And for photos, you will get more permanent, less expensive results in the long run by printing on real photo paper (Fuji Crystal) using online services such as Shutterfly, Ritz or even Costco - with no cost for capital equipment and paying just for little bits of materials as you use them. The NX415 is a good match for the home or home office user who needs occasional color photo printing, occasional document printing, occasional scanning, occasional copying, nothing to overstress the flimsy construction. Perhaps it would be placed with a computer you use only once a week. Here's a rule of thumb; if you replace the ink cartridges on this unit more than once a year, it is not such a good deal.Now to the test. I set the printer up and performed some color and black-and-white copies; this does not require a computer. Results were good and color copying was surprisingly accurate, close to the original with only a bit less contrast. For example this would be just right for copying a few old photos from grandma's album to give to other family members. Scanning worked fine and the Epson scanning software for my MacBook with OS 10.6 operated smoothly. As an experiment, I tried scanning a small object - a steel ruler - at the highest resolution, 9600 dpi. This worked essentially as a microscope, giving a highly detailed magnified scan - quite fun and great for your kids' science projects!Printing color digital images onto good quality Epson photo paper produced variable but sometimes lovely results with bright, soft colors and good skin tones. Overall the images lacked snap and contrast; they were not the very best I have seen from inkjets, but generally good. Also, I had trouble with banding. I adjusted the alignment and cleaned the nozzles in an attempt to eliminate the banding, but was not entirely successful, hence four stars. (Those plastic gears you know.) All of this playing around uses paper and ink.Bottom line: Although it is probably not durable, and it is certainly high maintenance, I am giving this unit four stars because it does most of what it is advertised to do - printing, copying scanning - with pretty nice results for a price less than taking your girlfriend out to a good restaurant. But consider it a light duty, limited life unit. The consumables are very expensive - once you start replacing cartridges, you have fallen into Epson's marketing trap.",4,Low initial cost but high maintenance,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",961,56,58,0.965517241,helpful

I find the statistical functions, especially regressions and distributions, and the calculus functions to be far more intuitive. You do not have to remember all the parameters needed to use these functions. The menus are very easy to understand and I do not find myself running to an inadequate help manual as I did on earlier calculators.The higher resolution and bigger screen give a much nicer presentation. Problems are entered and solved in text almost exactly as you would see in a book. Graphs also look more accurate and detailed.But there is one thing I DO NOT like on this calculator....THE BUTTONS!! The letter keys are small green keys nestled among the number and function keys. Hence you are constantly hitting the letter keys by accident and so you have to waste time correcting typing errors.Another huge negative for me is the awkward nature of the graphing screen when finding roots, max/min points, and points of intersection. To find roots as well as max/min points you have to trace along the graph and when the tracer arrives at the point it provides the coordinates on the screen. However, the coordinates are often conflicting with the same space as the graph itself and hence you cant read the point. So you have to grab the coordinates and drag them to a spot on the graph where you can see it. And if you happen to trace past the point too quickly, the coordinates disappear and you have to trace back again. The same procedure applies to max/min points. Finding graph information with the TI84 and TI89 is far easier and quicker.I also believe the snap on keyboard that converts the calculator to an 84 will eventually prove to be a bad idea.  How many of those keyboards are going to get broken or lost?Overall a decent calculator if you are willing to deal with some upfront frustration.

1152390,AUI5NU7TRLK9A,B00BAVKJT0,Tdarcos,"[40, 55]","Note that I speak about laser printers, while this is an LED printer it works the same way (as opposed to an inkjet) as laser by melting toner powder and fusing it to the page, so anything I say about laser printers applies to this one.Be aware that a laser or LED printer like this one does not use ink. It uses toner, which is either a wax-type solid like crayons, or a powder like flour or powdered sugar. (Circa 1995 I used to reload laser fax machines by refilling the tank from a bottle of black toner.) Similar to inkjet printers, the toner is packed in a cartridge that you replace when the cartridge runs low.I'm told from a review that this printer is a bit more expensive per print, the toner cartridges are around $50 for all 4 or about $18 each which will get you about 500 pages, for a cost of about 4c/page black, 24c/page color (it's possible to get laser printing in the 2c/page black range, 18c color). One reason for using laser or LED printing is that black pages are usually cheaper on laser or LED vs. inkjet but you often could not get inexpensive color laser printers. But with an LED printer like this it does bring the price point down.One thing I used to do was, to make letterheads, I would do ""spot color"". I would print the parts of blank letterhead in advance that were in color on an inkjet printer, then set those aside for when I'd print letters which I would print the black parts of the letter on the laser, reducing cost per page. The lower price point for LED printers like this reduces the cost for small-volume printing low enough to make it worthwhile to not go through all that effort and just use the LED printer for the entire document as opposed to a hybrid inkjet/laser solution.This printer does not do double sided, and if you do higher volumes, above 250 pages a month, you probably want a more expensive printer where the cost of toner is less. Unless you're printing less than 30-50 pages a month, or you're buying a multi-function printer because it's cheaper than a scanner alone and you're not really going to print much, always check the price for the consumables, which is ink cartridges for an inkjet, and toner cartridges and drums for a laser or LED. Check the estimated number of pages you get for the toner cartridge and the estimated number of pages the drum can handle. Most documents are about 5% coverage per page, but if you're doing photographs you're doing near 100%. If you print a lot of photos you may find it cheaper to take a jump drive or cdrw with your images to a drug store or photo store kiosk and print them there, often their price for photos is less than it will cost you to print them.But if you'd like something for medium volume this might not be a bad idea. Be advised a laser or LED has a separate drum for each color in addition to the toner, and in the case of a laser/LED printer replacing the drum is usually not worth it. I've bought inexpensive monochrome lasers where the printer was as low as $75, the toner cartridge which would do about 2000 pages was $60, but the drum which has to be replaced after about 6000 pages, cost $149 whereas you can buy a brand new or remanufactured printer with a brand-new drum for again, $80 to $100. So figure you'll keep buying toner cartridges as you run printouts but typically when a drum wears out you'll usually toss the printer and buy another one, probably with more features for less money.So account for the expected lifetime of the drum(s) because you'll have to spend as much as the printer costs either to replace the drum(s) (if you're crazy!) or (more likely) replace the printer.Paul RobinsonGeneral ManagerViridian Development Corporation",2,"Take note about costs, and printers like these don't use ink",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",670,40,55,0.727272727,helpful

The Dymo instantly paled in comparison the Brother unit, but was good enough until stopped working completely last week after it's second battery change caused some sort of malfunction from which it would not recover. The Brother label maker has been working very well for several years now and my only complaint about it is the waste of labels created by the huge margins (and when you consider the ridiculous cost if the these cartridges, that's a valid concern). So I came back to Amazon to do some quick research and decided to spend a little extra on the Epson LabelWorks LW-400 because reviewers had mentioned the smaller margins and that drove my decision to purchase.The quality of the labels the Epson LW-400 produces was unacceptable to me given my comparison to the Brother unit, which prints very crisp and sharp labels that last. I couldn't quite believe how low-res the labels from the Epson were, especially given the advancements that I assume have been made in the 5-7 years since I purchased the Brother unit. They were not at all crisp and sharp; rather the printing looked shaky and NONE of the fonts would print with a clear boundary; they were all ragged around the edges. And think that is unacceptable. It looked really fancy, and I'm sure it did some really cool things that my Brother unit couldn't do. But the priority of any label maker should be the clarity of the printing and the Epson failed miserably.I've returned the Epson LW-400 and will purchase another Brother unit.",2,Spectacularly Unimpressed,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",285,18,20,0.9,helpful

Though the product isn't perfect (more on this in a moment) it sure beats the alternative which would have been paying at least 4 times the price to have the magnet made professionally.  Additionally, an obvious benefit to creating projects on your own is the large amount of creativity your allowed.  My fiance and I included a professionally taken photo on our ""Save the Date"" and were able to fit 6 of them to a page.  Such a magnet done professionally would have cost at least $2 per 3""x4"" magnet, whereas doing it ourselves costs approximately .40 cents per magnet.About the product: it's very easy to use.  I would advise feeding one sheet at a time to make sure your printer doesn't take more than one sheet at a time (they are magnetic after all).  The print comes out beautifully and dries pretty quickly (we gave ours about 10 minutes just to be safe) and cuts pretty easily.The downside: a small handful of recipients told us that the edges bent slightly and never stuck completely to their refrigerator.  It was secure on the fridge, but not completely flat.  Another downside (one I only found out about because we put the wrong address and the magnet was returned to us) was that the ink smudged a little bit on the magnet.  We're hoping this was just an anomaly but we're still investigating.  It wasn't awful, but it was noticeable.Bottom line, the product isn't perfect but its the best out there if you want to do it yourself.  For us, we spent about $45 to make 120 magnets.

533115,A3IS6HB3B4M2YF,B001V9LQH0,H. T. Nelson,"[1136, 1170]","I purchased this scanner as a first step in creating an electronic filing system for a home office. As I accumulated 20 filing cabinet drawers of paper documents going paperless seemed to be an answer.Purchase of the Fujitsu S1500 was based on the numerous 5 star reviews. I am reasonably tech literate and have used the scanner for about 2 weeks. Here are my initial impressions:Pros -1. Speed: This scanner seems blazingly fast. Not a resource hog. Will scan duplex 20-25ppm at default settings on Win2K/1.8mhz/1gb platform.2. Scan quality very good at all settings.3. Size and looks: Small desk footprint. Looks great open or closed.4. Excellent paper feeding as long as documents are same size and 20# or greater paper weight.Cons -1. NO TWAIN DRIVER. I knew this going in but did not appreciate how much this would cripple the device in day to day use. Let me explain. I had envisioned creating a virtual file cabinet in my computer using Windows Directory/Folder/File system then scanning my paper documents into this system as pdf files. The problem is that the native Fujitsu software does not let you append an existing pdf file!!!As an example take a file for utility bills. D:/Home Expenses/Utilities/Gas_Electric.pdf. You can easily scan in all prior bills(limited by 50 sheet ADF)and a pdf with one page for each bill will be created. But if you had more than 50 prior bills or when next months bill comes then the next scan you perform to include these new documents will create a new pdf and does not allow the option of appending this current scan to the existing pdf. As you can see one could easily end up with 1000s of individual pdf documents in your filing system. The work around is to launch Adobe Acrobat (not reader) and use it to open the old composite pdf and use Acrobat to append the newly created pdf to the prior file. This work around takes longer than scanning in a 30 page document. Twain based scanners easily work with existing windows file structure and allow you to append an existing pdf without invoking Acrobat.2. Paper catch tray very fragile and ADF paper support does not stay up (also reported by other reviewers).3. Double feed sensor: stops scan and reports. This is good. However you cannot retrieve the double fed sheet and place it back in proper order because the next sheet is already in the scanner and cannot be backed out. You have to either cancel the scan and start over or put the unread sheet back in out of order and then use Acrobat to rearrange the pages in the resultant pdf document. If you choose to cancel the scan the document that is halfway into the scanner will not be ejected and you need to perform an new scan to retrieve that sheet.4. A scanning run will only handle one size document at a time. In my experience if you have a mix of paper sizes you will need to do a scanning run for each paper size. Each run will generate a separate pdf file with you will then need to deal with.5. I paid extra for the scanner bundle with Rack2File software thinking it would help me create the filing system I envisioned. After loading and spending several hours with this software I don't understand how it works or what it is supposed to do. I consider the extra $30 dollars I spent for the ""bundled"" scanner money poorly spent.6. Other minor annoyances are:While the scanner and snapscan software will run on older platforms the bundled software Rack2file and Acrobat require XPpro SP3 or newer. This is not clear from specs.ADF will hold 40-50 sheets but output tray will start to jam after 20-25 sheets.Documents printed on less than 20# paper and with printing on both sides the back side printing will show up on the front side scan. Many commercial invoices are printed both sides on thin paper.Cannot set several default scanning profiles. You need to reset the scanner parameters each time you want a different profile.Bottom line:This would be a 5 star low end document scanner if it only offered a twain driver. As it is I can recommend it only to prospective buyers who understand the full implications of this limitation. I thought of returning this scanner and getting one of the twain based models like the Epson GT S50 but at this point I have learned enough of Acrobat to quickly append my pdfs retrospectively.I strongly recommend avoiding the ""bundled"" product since I don't see what added value the Rack2File software brings.I considered giving the scanner a one star review just to get people's attention but the hardware is so good 3 stars seems about right.",3,Good hardware but no twain driver is a significant limitation,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",795,1136,1170,0.970940171,helpful

89990,A1JE9O1J1IXHKI,B00007MC6Z,Amy McKenize,"[33, 34]","The size and weight of this big-cube-shaped printer are reminiscent of the first generation of black and white laser printers. Print quality is good. Colour pictures won't pass as photographs, but quality is acceptable, and, because the printer is a laser, you can get good results with cheap paper.I am not normally a big fan of Samsung products, which, in my experience, seem to favor style over support and quality control. In this case, however, the design of the printer is simple and elegant, which - I hope - will translate into improved reliability. The four colour cartridges are arranged horizontally, rather than in a circular carousel. It's hard to pass up a duplexing color printer for less than the cost of some non-duplexing, black and white models. Doors on all sides give good access to the interior of the printer, although opening the door to the toner compartment is a little like opening a Japanese puzzle box. You open the door to get it halfway open, then pull out the top cartridge, which allows you to open the door all the way.The printer is quiet - for a color laser printer. When it's in ""sleep mode"", it's silent. When it's printing, it whirs and clunks and sounds like most other laser printers. After printing, its fan runs for some minutes. The other laser printers I've owned made the lights flicker when they printed. So does this one. It takes a couple of minutes for the printer to wake up and print the first page. After that, it prints at close to the advertised speeds.One of the most valuable features of this printer, and the one that sold me on it, is the duplexing (double-sided printing). It slows down the printing a little, but it saves paper, and also toner, if you print using booklet mode (see below). The duplexing works in an unusual way - each page is pushed out of the printer, but just before it completely emerges, the printer pulls it back in again and flips it around internally. If, like me, you have the bad habit of pulling sheets out of the printer as they are emerging, you may find yourself getting into a tug of war with a piece of paper the printer wants back.Duplexing is well supported by the Windows based printer driver. ""Booklet mode"" is ideal for printing out long user manuals. It will print pages out in half-size, arranged two to a side, and double sided. It automatically puts the pages in the right order to make a booklet. So, if you are printing 64 pages, the first page to emerge will have pages 1 and 64 on one side, and 2 and 63 on the other. Once all the pages have emerged, just staple the center (you'll need a long-arm stapler) and fold it in half and you have a very nice looking booklet. In this mode, a 64 page document can be printed using 16 sheets of paper, and 32 pages of toner.Consumables for the Samsung seem to be slightly higher in price than those for other laser printers, but obviously far cheaper than inkjets. Like most color lasers, it comes with ""fun sized"" cartridges, each good for 1500 pages or so. If you print a lot of full colour pages, you can use these up pretty quickly. Replacement cartridges are supposed to be good for 5000 pages. (7000 for black.)There's a waste toner cartridge in the front of the printer which is supposed to be replaced every few thousand pages, although if you empty the toner dust out carefully into a plastic baggie you can easily reuse it.Unlike most color lasers in this price range, this one comes with expandable memory, and a good sized standard paper tray (350 sheets). The auxiliary tray seems to handle light card stock quite well - nice if you want covers for your booklets. Again, this is well supported by the driver, which allows you to specify a different paper source for the first page, allowing you to print booklet covers on card stock automatically.",4,Boxy but good,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",682,33,34,0.970588235,helpful

I say this because if you were to buy it will you be paying $80 every two - three months to replace your ink cartridges.Brother has a scam built into to thier printer which cleans the ink cartridges about 3 to 4 times a day.  Everytime the cleaning cycle goes through it uses a little bit of ink at a time.  Over a very quick course of time all of your ink cartridges are empty thus forcing you to spend $80 to replace all of your cartridges.  So far I know of no effort by Brother to fix this situation.  Thus in my opionion thier Unique Selling Proposition seems to be give away the devices and screw the customer in the long run by forcing them to replace ink.If it weren't that all the ink cartridges run out after two months all at the same time.  When they run empty it completly shuts down the printer.  You will not be able to send a fax or do anything with the printer!  Even of only one of the color cartridges goes empty it will shut down the printer.  You will not be able to fax, recieve a fax or do black copies if the color ink runs out!

It includes casters (the front pair of which can lock) to make it easier to move your system.  The height of the front legs is adjustable (four settings) allowing you to tilt the case to various angles making it easier to access the drives, USB ports, etc.  The back support brackets are also adjustable (two positions) to allow for a deeper case.  Finally, the width is adjustable to allow for various case widths.  I'd be surprised if there's a case this CPU stand couldn't handle.The only slight problem is that the side supports of the stand partially block the ventilation intakes if the width of the stand is set to fit the case snugly.  However, this problem is easily overcome by simply leaving about a finger-width's worth of space between the stand and case to allow for airflow.

639661,A3LD60ZLSISITH,B002WER27Q,G. Venkatesh,"[9, 10]","This is one of the best lapdesks I have found but it has a number of caveats depending on the use that determines the star rating. I will cover three different use cases below that people may buy this for.1. It is 5 stars if you just want to use this as a base for a laptop without an external mouse especially if your laptop gets hot at the bottom. The lapdesk gives a comfortable cushioning much better than the laptop itself. It is a bit too bulky (about 22"" width) a solution for small laptops if you don't use an external mouse. It is wide enough to accommodate the largest laptop. You can use it inclined. Do note that the width (a little over 22"" at the widest) will make it difficult to use in most standard width chairs that have armrests. But for this use case, you might as well buy the Model 45303 from the same company that is cheaper and less bulky.2. It is 3 stars if you want to use an external mouse for anything more than occasional use. The problems area. Giving enough space for the mouse on the left or right (there are pads on either side) requires you to place the laptop off-center. If you keep the lapdesk centered on your lap (the only comfortable position), you are then typing at an odd angle since the keyboard is not centered in front of you. The further you center the laptop, the less space you have for the mouse to make it usable. Using the mouse at the very edge may be uncomfortable to many because of the ledge at the bottom. The smaller the laptop, less of a problem this is.b. Keeping the lapdesk inclined makes use of an external mouse impossible as the mouse keeps sliding down and moving the cursor on the screen. Most mice have smooth pads at the bottom.c. Most mice are very noisy if moved anywhere on the hard plastic outside the fixed felt pads. Using the very edge for the mouse to center the laptop better makes it difficult to avoid this.So use of an external mouse is recommended only if it is a small/micro laptop mouse that doesn't require much space or you have a less than 12"" laptop AND more importantly you do not expect to keep your legs (and hence the lapdesk) inclined.3. It is 2 stars for use as a base for just a keyboard and a mouse unless your keyboard is 15"" or less in width. Even then it suffers from all of the problems in case 2 above. The bigger problem is that most keyboards are 19""+ or are so tiny that they cannot be used for serious work. A standard keyboard, while it will fit with mouse area, either leaves no space for the mouse if centered or has to be used off-centered. So you have all the problems mentioned in case 2 above for a laptop and external mouse and as if you had a 18""+ wide laptop.This usage is best if you use a keyboard with a trackpad built into it so it can be used centered on the lapdesk (like the use of a single laptop in the first case above without an external mouse).So, think about your usage carefully before purchasing this, as you may or may not be happy with this product for your requirements.

If you are a photographer looking for a printer that that can accept a variety of papers and deliver beautiful permanent prints (up to 13x19) every single time for a reasonable price, then I can highly recommend the Pro 9500 Mk II.  I have used it for numerous professional jobs and it has never let me down.Who should NOT buy this printer?- Don't buy this if you want an everyday printer to print out email, Google maps, web pages, etc. The LUCIA inks that this printer uses are designed to produce beautiful photographs that last 100 years.  It's a complete waste of money to use them for everyday trivial prints.  Buy a cheap inkjet for $100 if that's what you want to do.- Don't buy this printer and attempt to feed it cheap 3rd party inks.  The whole reason this printer exists is to delivery highly stable LUCIA inks to fine photography papers.  Cheap inks defeat the purpose of owning this printer, and won't give the same results.  The LUCIA inks for this printer run about $120 for a set. I go through several sets a year, so the expendables for this printer are not insignificant.- If you want to print 500 photos in ten minutes, please go to a photo printing service. This printer is designed to produce spectacularly beautiful high resolution fine art prints one print at a time.  It takes 5-10 mins to produce a single 13x19 photo, but it's worth the wait.  It's not designed for super high volume speedy printing.- Don't buy this printer if you are not willing to devote the time to master ICC color profiles and professional level photo applications such as Lightroom, Photoshop, or Aperture.  Sure the 9500 can print from any photo program, but if you want to realize the highest quality fine art prints that you can produce, then you'll have to use professional tools.  This means having a proper workflow, a calibrated monitor, and the willingness to learn how to get better at producing fine art prints.- Don't buy this printer if you plan to purchase cheap paper in bulk at Staples.  You are wasting your time and money.  Buy quality fine art papers and this printer will reward you every time.  My favorite papers to use with the 9500 are:Ilford Gold Fibre Silk - one of the best all around Baryta coated papers. Absolutely beautifulCanson Infinity Baryta - another great Baryta paperHahnem&uuml;hle fine art papers such as Museum Etching, William Turner, and Bamboo - wonderful heavy matte papersRed River Polar Pearl Metallic - a stunning paper that makes photos punchier and dramaticIlford Premium Photo Glossy - a resin coated paper that I use for high gloss photos or for printing proof sheets-Don't buy this printer if you plan to leave it unused for six months at a time.  You are just asking for a head clog. I sometimes go a month without using it, and have never had a problem, but I wouldn't push it much longer than that.  If you don't need to print anything, then run a test print through every three or four weeks to keep the inks flowing and the head from clogging with dried ink.  You don't want a stubborn head clog when you are under deadline.How to get the most out of this printer.- Download and use the specific ICC color profiles for each paper for which you intend to print.  Most fine art paper companies provide downloadable profiles for this printer.- Calibrate your monitor.- Work in a high gamut colorspace such as ProRGB or Adobe RGB.  If you are shooting and working in sRGB, you simply won't realize the full potential of this printer.- Know how to use your photo application software specifically for printing. Look into getting pro-level software if you don't have it. These applications will allow the computer to do the color management instead of the printer, and you will get much finer control. Plus the editing capabilities of these programs will allow you to make very fine adjustments and tweaks.- By using the paper manufacturers ICC profiles, you won't be limited to the wide borders that this printer imposes on prints done with the built in profiles- Make sure you have up-to-date drivers.- Keep the printer doors closed up when you are not using it to keep the dust out.- Alway keep an spare set of inks handy so that you can replace a cartridge that runs out in the middle of a print.  If you replace the ink promptly, the 9500 will continue the print without a hiccup.- If you want to print on heavyweight (or thick) papers, learn to use the front feed feature.  This printer has a fantastic straight paper path for thick or heavyweight media.If you do all of these things, I hope you will find this printer as enjoyable as I have over the last two and half years.UPDATE:  It's December 2013 and I have had this printer for almost 5 years.  It's still going strong with no problems to report, and it still makes absolutely beautiful prints.",5,Understand this printer before you buy!,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",882,157,158,0.993670886,helpful

128421,A2S9TVFGPC8YPO,B0002KK63Y,Serge A. Vecher,"[37, 38]","Being one of the first Wi-Fi VoIP (SIP) phones on the market, ZyXEL Prestige 2000W is a solid proof of concept that is deemed by many to see explosive growth. With this unit, ZyXEL seems to be targeting two markets - a cordless phone for corporate SIP environments and residential broadband VoIP services (like Vonage). The unit gets 3 stars for actually working in one deployment scenario, but lacking many required features.We have received several units from ZyXEL in October to investigate a deployment scenario with Asterisk PBX as a SIP server. The phone picked up a signal of our internal 802.11b/g wireless network with no problems. However, the initial attempt to register with Asterisk server was unsuccessful. Upgrading firmware to version 'f' solved the registration problem and now we could successfully move on to evalute phone's functionality.Positive impressions:1. Reception of Wi-Fi signal is good and is on par with other wireless devices (we compared to notebooks with WiFi cards).2. Sound quality is very good and is comparable to your average cellphone.3. Battery life is decent and will handle several hours of talktime. Standby mode is not as effective as with your modern cellphone, therefore the phone has to be charged every night.4. Unit is fairly compact and lightweight (about the size of an older Nokia cellphone).Unfortunateluly, this is where the positive impressions end. To give ZyXEL some credit, core technology seems be in good shape and the unit lacks any serious drawbacks. However, many important features one would expect in a cordless communication device are underimplemented or not implemented at all:1. Phone looks and feels old, like one of the cellphones from the 90's. Screen is tiny and only has four lines.2. Handsfree - both speakerphone and headset ports exist, but are not functional.3. Battery compartment is very hard to open. Not that one should have to take out the battery that often, but this is the only way to reboot the phone when it occasionally locks up.4. Only one incoming line is implemented.5. Phone registers to a SIP server only upon bootup. Therefore, if the connection to the server is lost during normal operation, the phone will have to be rebooted.6. Hold, transfer, and conference buttons are not implemented. As is the MWI (Message Waiting Indicator).7. Wireless security is underimplemented. On paper, WEP up to 128 bits is possible, in reality that means you will have to punch in the keys manually (use the web interface for that) and quality of sound will deteriorate. WEP keys are easy to break anyways, so that leaves you with MAC Address filtering - wait, that's easy to spoof also. So do not bother yourself with security on this phone.8. You have to know your SSID to access the wireless AP. No autodiscovery and no ability to store several SSIDs and to connect to whichever one is found first.9. The lists for missed and dialed calls exist, but are out of order (at least chronological one). Plus, no details are offered.10. Ringtones are godawful and cannot be changed.In summary:1. Corporate clients will be turned off by the lack of multiple lines, transfer and hold functionality, and lack of security.2. Service providers, like Vonage, seem to prefer analog adapters to end devices that talk native VoIP protocols. In the case of Vonage, one may be able use Prestige 2000W on their network using credentials issued for the SoftPhone service. But given the extra charge for the service as well as the premium price of Prestige 2000W itself, the economics are against such scenario. It is much more economical for residential customer to purchase an analog or digital cordless phone in 900Mhz or 5.8Ghz spectrum and use it through VoIP provider's telephone adapter.Unless you have an extra $250 laying around and like your technology raw, patience will be rewarded. New and improved WiFi SIP Phones are starting to show up. For example, Hitachi Cable's IP-5000 looks more modern and supports advanced security features like WPA and EAP-TLS (there are reports, however, of poor firmware design and incompatibility). Cisco 7920 seems to be dominant in the large corporate sector and may capture small and medium-business markets if they finally release SIP firmware and work on lowering the $500+ price-tag.Motorola is releasing a CN620, which as a hybrid GSM/WiFi SIP phone for the corporate market.There is a lot of development in this area and kudos to ZyXEL for braving the turbulent waters. Hopefully, they can improve on hardware design, add more firmware features and turn the ugly duckling that Prestige 2000W is into a beatiful swan.(...)",3,Solid Proof of Concept,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",760,37,38,0.973684211,helpful

I have extra USB cables around the house and went ahead and bought a B&W; cartridge for the printer right away.Reading some of the reviews here, I conclude that customers who bought the HP Deskjet 3520 from an online seller didn't have the opportunity to know what was and wasn't included.

I had to often go to task manager and then restart the program in order to continue. It gets very annoying and time-consuming when half the time you have to restart the program just to do a receipt.

But last evening I colored a mandala using the premier prismacolors. Somewhere online I found a video of how to sharpen prismacolor pencils. It's interesting that some artist prefer electric sharpeners and some think electric sharpeners break the lead.First of all regarding the pencils ... what causes the leads to break has nothing to do with the sharpener. The pencils could have been dropped at the warehouse or slipped from a shelf before you even bought it.  After I had purchased mine I found the video and it says you should carry them home flat (like you would carry a bakery cake) and to keep them flat at home.  In fact it was recommended to buy a holder like the one shown here by Tran.[[ASIN:B002YKLSI2 Tran Deluxe Pencil Cases - Pencil Case for 72 Pencils]  There is also one made by Globe.  They come in various sizes but it's a good idea that you order the next size up (if you have 24 pencils get the case that holds 30).Now about the sharpening.  In the video the woman said that whether you use an electric or hand-held sharpener be sure to sharpen a regular graphite pence after the fourth colored pencil. Graphite is a lubricant and will help keep the blades sharp.  Then she demonstrated taking the the bottom off the Prismacolor sharpener. Hold you pencil and sharpener as you normally would, then SWITCH hands.  Instead of turning the pencil in the sharpener, hold the pencil straight and turn the sharpener around it.  This was very hard for me to do.  But I learned that I definitely exert some kind of pressure when I sharpen pencils that often causes them to have more of the wood show on one side.I will say the Prismacolor sharpener did not eat the pencils as my electric sharpener did.  The electric one made them too pointy. As several other posters have shared, the Prismacolor sharpener does tend to get filled with the soft lead and I had to find something to pry the last of the shavings out of the sharpener itself.  That is why I did not give this a 5 rating.  However I did just as good a job using the Staetler sharpener [[ASIN:B004E2Q3XS Staedtler Products - Staedtler - Handheld Metal Manual Pencil Sharpener, Silver 4/Pack - Sold As 1 Pack - Blade attached at three points for greater precision and sharper tips. - Extra-long pencil gliding slot prevents wedging. - Cutout makes it easy to...]]  I bought mine with a coupon while waiting for this prismacolor sharpener to arrive.

Over other machines this is the one to buy.The machine is fit for the basket.  Use plastic bags for the refuse.The door to the cutters (on the bottom) open up and you can see if anything is stuck.So far that has never happened.When emptying the basket, Close the door to cutter to avoid having cut paper going all over the place.5. How it works, When you first purchase the product the door is closed.  But it may be open.  The door stays open when operating.  When pulling out, close the door.6. Blades with door open may be brushed to rid of excess paper.7. Oil prevents jams.8. The product is not light weight.  Heavy.  You must use the basket that comes with the machine.

I have more than several pensand when I want to test them, especially with a new ink, I will first try notebook paper, then copy paperfinally the Rhodia. When they don't perform well on either of the first two, they more than likely will writesmoothly with the Dot Pad.

I keep my ink journal on a few of the pages so I can compare my different ink samples.The best thing about the Rhodia stapled Dot Pads are the pages are micro-perforated so tearing out a pageleaves a very fine edge at the top, barely noticeable.As the description states, one gets 80 pages for about 10 bucks, so not exactly throw away quality, butthe pad seems to last at the rate I am using it.

758241,A1XJLU9CSW9PN3,B003YT6RLK,Scott D. Cerreta,"[272, 282]","I have a small home office and use this printer primarily for business type tasks. I replaced a Samsung All-in-One Laser printer with this HP All-in-One. I will also be writing reviews for other devices that I use for business travel and backcountry backpacking including: HP Officejet Pro 8500A Plus AirPrint enabled printer, Solio Rocsta H1000 Solar Charger and Verizon MiFi 2200, five device 3G mobile broadband HotSpot. Click on the ""See all my Reviews"" link above.=== Background Information ===The primary features that were critical to my decision were AirPrint, duplex printing, and double sided copying. None of these features were available on the Samsung. HP is the only company that offers AirPrint. This allows printing directly from iOS4.2 enabled iPad, iPod Touch 4th Gen, and iPhone 4. ePrinting is not the same and I will discuss the advantages of both. HP also offers a free app for the iPod devices called iPrint. I will explore some of those cool features.This review will also compare a few feature differences between the 8500A and the 8500A plus. I was very close to buying the 8500A, but opted for the improved features of the 8500A Plus. I hope this comparison will allow you to make a better choice too.=== AirPrint compared to ePrint ===Another feature unique to the Apple iPod Touch 4th Gen device, iPad, and iPhone 4 is AirPrint. It should be noted that the iPod Touch 3rd gen with iOS4.2 cannot AirPrint. One more reason that swayed my decision to buy the 4th Gen device. AirPrint is different from ePrinting. AirPrint allows you to print almost anything like, documents, PDFs, photos, Internet pages and Internet PDFs to an HP AirPrint enabled printer. You cannot ePrint Internet pages or Internet PDF files. AirPrinting occurs instantly. ePrinting has a slight delay before the job prints.You can get around this feature by opening Internet PDF files like an owner's manual to an HP printer, in HP iPrint. This is a free app available for iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone. Then inside iPrint, you can email the PDF to your printer from anywhere in the world using WiFi. I enjoy recipe hunting on the Internet and this is a true advantage of AirPrint over ePrint. When you find the recipe, just print it straight from the Internet. You cannot do this with ePrint or HP iPrint. Another unique feature of AirPrint is double sided printing, to save on paper. ePrint does not allow double sided printing.Photos look amazing when printing directly from the iPod Touch. Even photos taken from the iPod Touch look good.  AirPrint does have a limitation. This is a feature that allows you to print while on the same WiFi network. So, if I travel to another part of the state, I cannot AirPrint to the home office. However, if the hotel has an AirPrint enabled printer then you can print to it. ePrinting is different.Many HP printers and other brands offer ePrinting. This is a very cool feature that allows you to print from your iPod Touch 4th Gen to an ePrinter through email. Your ePrinter must be connected to a WiFi network and it is assign a specific email address. Then, while travelling on the road away from the home network, I can email a document or photo to the ePrinter's email address and viola, done. The limitation with ePrint is that not all applications will allow you to send an email from within the application. You cannot ePrint Internet pages or Internet PDFs. Only HP printers (and only a handful of models) are equipped for AirPrint. Check out this page for AirPrint enabled printers: [...]Only the Photosmart series comes with AirPrint in the firmware. The Officejet A series printers require a firmware upgrade. I did this in the initial installation process and it was very easy to perform. You cannot download the firmware from the HP website. I wasted 30 minutes trying to find it. You upgrade the firmware by accessing the user panel on the printer. Go to Setup Menu / Web Services / Product Update.=== HP iPrint app for iPod Touch, iPad, iPhone ===Another cool application is iPrint by HP. It is a free app for iPod devices and probably other android devices too, but not sure with those. iPrint will allow you to print photos, saved files like PDFs and direct printing from your iPod Touch or iPhone camera. I can really get all this with the AirPrint feature, so no big deal here.iPrint differs in that you can directly scan documents and work files directly to a saved folder in your iPod device. You can then open, view, share, and print those scanned pages. They will automatically be saved as PDFs.  Another feature is that you can wirelessly transfer files from your home network computer to your iPod device. Then you can open, share, and print those. For example, I can upload some recipes from home and share them with co-workers at the office. Do note that you won't be able to open word documents with file extension .doc or .docx.  So, be sure to convert those files to PDFs before importing.iPrint also seems like it would be very useful for android devices too, since it allows for options to be selected unlike ePrinting. In HP iPrint you can print grayscale or color, select your paper size, and choose double sided printing.=== HP 8500A vs. 8500A Plus ===The most obvious difference between the two models is a larger LCD screen and a slightly larger ADF tray. The 8500A Plus holds 50 sheets compared to 35 on the 8500A. When looking at the specs, it is hard to see the differences. When I played with two machines at a local store there are several key features beyond the screen size.The 8500A Plus has a full scale copy feature similar to what you would have with a $5000 copier at an office. It will perform the following key tasks:1 sided to 2 sided2 sided to 1 sided2 sided to 2 sidedPrinting can be done to short edge or long edge.The 8500A would not copy 2 sided to 2 sided, which is the most common type of scanning and printing tasks that I perform. For this reason alone, I opted for the 8500A Plus. I did see a few other tasks that the 8500A Plus would perform over the 8500A, but I do not recall the details.=== Summary ===HP 8500A Plus is a step up from the 8500A, offering key features with printing and copying that will save you time and money, like 2 sided to 2 sided copies. Both of these printers will allow for ePrint, HP iPrint, and the highly beloved Apple AirPrint. Only the AirPrint feature will allow you to print directly from the Internet to an HP AirPrint enabled printer. All these features come with a reliable, high quality printer with high capacity ink cartridges for cost savings.",5,Comparing HP Officejet Pro 8500A Plus vs. 8500A and ePrint and AirPrint Features,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",1155,272,282,0.964539007,helpful

The salesman showed me the most highly rated HP all in one.  The features were good, but I just couldn't believe how cheap and plasticky the HP machines felt!  I could literally pick it up with one hand, and the lid hinges were so cheap that I couldn't see how they'd last more than a few months.  Disgusted, I asked about other models, and that's when he showed me the Canon line.I must admit that Canon printers were prety much totally off my radar screen.  But in looking at them closer, I was REALLY impressed with the build quality of the MP530.  I also liked the individual ink cartridges (which are transparent so you can SEE if they're empty or not) and the low cost-per-page print costs compared to HP, epson, etc.  Double-sided copies and high quality photo printing were just icing on the cake!I just got the MP530 a few days ago, and so far I'm REALLY impressed--this may be the best printer I've ever had!  Printed text files are razor sharp--you really have a hard time telling that it's not from a laser printer.  The copy machine feature works great (two-sided copies are a little slow but one-sided are really, really fast!) I also like the document feed tray on top that auto-feeds the copier (or FAX) saving me time.  I also really like that you can have two differant types of paper loaded at the same time (i.e. photo paper and plain white copier paper) and you can select the tray/paper with the click of a button.The FAX machine works great--easy to set up and easy to use.  Same thing for the scanner.  While the resolution is high, I still wouldn't try to realistically scan negatives, slides, or photos and expect top-quality results, but hey, this unit sells for less than $200!!! Scaniing text and even photos into a PDF file is simple and fast.Maybe one of the best features (that many other copier/printer companies DO NOT have) you can actually remove and replace the print head!  The print heads on some inkjet printers will clog if they're not used regularly (Epson's are notorious for this) but if the heads can't be unplugged by the self-diagnostic program you basically have to throw the printer out because sending it in for a factory print head replacement will cost more than buying a new printer!All in all I'm totally impressed with this Canon all-in-one and I HIGHLY recommend it to others!!UPDATE!!! 1/09: Despite my initial enthusiasm with this printer, I can now say that I would NOT recommend this printer to anyone!!! Why? Because Canon puts profits before customer satisfaction byprogramming their printers to COMPLETELY STOP WORKING IF JUST ONEINK CARTRIDGE IS LOW!!! I discovered this when one of my color ink cartridges ran low, thus shutting down the entire printer--not even allowing me to print in black and white even though both black ink cartridges were brand new! I was on a very important deadline and I desperately needed to FAX a document, but because Canon cripples their printers in order to get you go and buy their new ink cartridges right away, I was unable to print what I needed. I even called Canon's customer service, and they admitted that yes, even if all the other cartridges are full if one is low the printer will not function at all!!!Additionally, because Canon wants to make sure that you ONLY buy their over-priced ink cartridges, each cartridge comes with a little computer chip on it whose sole purpose is to ensure that you don't buy and can't use aftermarket ink cartridges that cost far less.  While this system may work well to protect Canon's profits, several of the factory Canon cartridges that I bought new would not work because the printer refused to identify and use them because there are known problems with the ink cartridge chips not being read correctly by the printer!As a consumer, I'm sick and tired of all the proprietary nonsense that the printer manufacturers force upon us just to protect their outrageous markups on the ink cartridges. I refuse to do business with Canon until they stop crippling their customer's printers just to increase theirink sales.

The only true complaint that I have reviewed is that the low number of copies each toner cartridge produces.  At less than a 1000 pages per cartridge it is an expensive printer to operate.I am the owner of two older HP Laserjet 2300dn printers which can be found on a major online auction site refurbished for approximately the cost of this printer.  My experience has been that the majority of these printers s were low volume lease returns.  The HP Laserjet 2300dn printers originally sold for more than $1100 each.  The primary advantage of a HP Laserjet 2300dn over a HP Laserjet Pro 1606dn is that each toner cartridge produces approximately 6000 pages versus less than a 1000.  The cost of the HP 2300dn cartridges vary from approximately $30 for remanufactured cartridges to $125 for HP OEM cartridges generating a cost per page from a half a cent to two cents per page.  The HP 2300s were designed for a duty cycle of 25,000 pages per month.If you are interested in good graphics, the HP Laserjet 2300dn does 1200 dpi which is acceptable for most b&w; text.  If you need magazine quality (approx. 2500dpi), this is not your printer.  It is also cheap to add additional memory for large or complex jobs.  I added an extra 256MB memory on each printer for about $50.Both of my printers are network printers using hp jetdirect 10/100 cards which can be added to all models of the HP2300.  Another advantage of HP2300dn is that it has a lighted lcd configuration panel to confirm status problems.I purchased both of my HP Laserjet 2300dn printers with less than a 2000 pages printed on them. They were virtually new machines.  I am just offering another point of view for those who need lower cost printing at this printer's price point.

I bought mine from a local store and have had it about a week. It comes in a huge box, but don't worry, this MFC is large but not too large compared to the other Brother mono laser all-in-ones (of which I have owned three over the years). The print quality is EXCELLENT and very fast for full color (21 pages per minute). My only initial concern was that it creased envelopes when printing on envelopes......but after consulting the manual there are fuser tension adjustment switches that solves that for perfect envelope printing (Settings, A, B and Envelope). I had compared many all-in-one color laser machines for many years (including recent ones from Xerox and HP). I was surprised that HP hadn't come out with a great, feature rich one yet. Brother beat HP to the punch and it is a knockout for sure. I am replacing a higher end Minolta color laser with flatbed scanner, a Brother MFC mono, and an HP mono workhorse with this ONE MFC-9840CDW!!! I am very very picky with print quality but this one is great! Bonus features are built-in duplex scanning, duplex printing, and wireless network capability!

In a flash you can pull out the tiny little pen that lives inside.  It's a great pen - pressurized like a Fischer space pen - and never leaks.  If you have a second you can unscrew the tube case from the keychain, unscrew the bottom from the tiny pen, and then screw the case onto the pen to make a lovely and functional full sized pen.Why bother?  For me, I always had a ton of cheap ballpoint pens in my pack and sometimes they'd leak and whenever I didn't have my bag I didn't have a pen.  The Inka means I ALWAYS have a good pen on me.  I'll stop accumulating disposable pens (which will help the environment in a tiny way) and stop getting messy ink in my pack.This thing is the bees knees and the only way to improve on it is to spend a bit more money for the titanium version.  The functional and aesthetic difference between stainless and titanium is trivial, however.  Don't think twice.My only quibble is that the PDA stylus part lives in the back of the pen - so you can't construct a full sized PDA stylus pen (the metal tube needs to screw in where the PDA stylus part lives.  This means that when you use Inka as a PDA stylus you must use it in ""tiny pen"" mode which makes it ergonomically not much better than the normal PDA stylus.  Also, you have the end cap of Inka in your hand because it normally stows over the PDA stylus tip.  So - final conclusion - Inka is the perfect solution to the personal pen issue for folks with a keychain who don't wear a jacket all the time.

With such glowing reviews, I wasn't sure if anything could live up to my expectations, but this baby exceeded them!  It uses ink cartridges at about 1/4 the rate of my old HP, and each cartridge costs less than 1/2 as much, so with the amount I print as a college student, it will actually pay for itself by the end of the next school year.  Besides the ink use, though, it's just beautifully designed, especially in terms of the scroll-wheel user interface.  You can scan a PDF, make copies, etc. from the machine, rather than having to log into a control panel software on the computer like I did with my old HP.  The top is completely flat and the screen folds down when you're not using it (and can actually stay shut while printing), so I got a little cloth to put over the top to protect the printer and it functionally extends the usable surface area of my desk, which no other printer has done.  Also, for those who know something about printing, its register is incredible!  I printed a sheet full of several hundred teeny tiny yellow stars, then printed the same image with blue stars right on top of it (I meant to print on the back but forgot to flip the paper over), and the result was perfect green stars with no side-to-side shifting at all.  I've never encountered a printer that could do that.  Also, this baby can print clean to the edge of 8.5x11, which means that when I need a school project to bleed off the edge, I no longer have to pay for an 11x17 print at the library and then trim it down manually.

And it was about what I expected to assemble the product - took about an hour. But once assembled, it wasn't very good. First off, the locking mechanism to prevent both drawers from open at once, is a joke. The first time I tried it to see if it works, I had the bottom drawer open and I slowly started to open the top drawer. It came open a tiny bit, but stopped. ""Great"" I thought. So I closed the top drawer and promptly heard a snapping noise and saw the plastic stopper piece fall into the bottom drawer - broken. So much for the locking mechanism to prevent both drawers from opening at the same time. And the cabinet itself is kind of chinsy. All the pieces don't line up exactly right, so it's a little askew and the bottom drawer doesn't shut properly. And the holes to install the drawer handles didn't line up for two of the four handles, so I had to drill my own - which isn't a big deal, but they should line up from the manufacturer. Overall, it was a good price, but I see why it was such a good price. This product still suits my needs so I'll keep it. But if I could have compared it to another option before purchasing it, I'd have gladly paid the extra $25-$30 for a sturdier unit.January 2013: This is an update to my original review. I originally rated this product 3 stars because I thought it was a bit flimsy. I've downgraded that to one star because the quality is worse than I thought. I've owned this file cabinet for barely two months and it's 1/2 - 2/3 full, so it's not packed to the gills. Today when I went to open the bottom drawer, it literally fell apart dumping my files all over the floor. I also had to act fast to steady the file cabinet because once the bottom drawer fell apart, the cabinet was about to tip over onto me. So I had to remove the top drawer too. I've had this file cabinet less than 2 months and it literally fell apart and is no longer usable. I've contacted the seller to see if they'll issue a refund, or how they'll handle the matter. Updates on that to come.....January 2013 - update #2: I got a prompt response from OfficeMax - a form reply saying sorry, but it's not our problem - here's the contact information for the manufacturer, go deal with them. I'm disappointed, because I expected OfficeMax would at least offer to help to remediate the issue if dealing with the manufacturer didn't work out. But what struck me was their response clearly stated that since I've owned the product over 30 days (I've owned it barely 60 days), OfficeMax isn't responsible at all and they've washed their hands of the matter. As a result, I'd recommend customers purchase from somebody other than OfficeMax because other vendors are more likely to be concerned and offer assistance when a customer has a bad experience with a product purchased from them. I purchase a lot of items on Amazon and a few times I've had issues with the products purchased (not a complaint, it's just reality), and up till now the vendors have always been very responsive and helpful in rectifying the situation. Dealing with OfficeMax is the first time a vendor on Amaxon didn't offer any assistance, other than to push me off to someone else.January 2013 - update #3: In fairness to OfficeMax I'm providing another update. After expressing dissatisfaction with their response, OfficeMax decided to make an ""exception"" and gave me a refund for the purchase of this product. Which is good because the manufacturer phone # I was provided with only allowed the option to leave a message for a call back, but after three messages I haven't yet received a call back from the manufacturer. So, in the end, OfficeMax did make good on the refund so I have to acknowledge that. But it was only after I expressed dissatisfaction and let them know I had included their initial customer service response in my review on Amazon.

The network set up instantly with little thought, the fax works and the network scanning seems to function.  However, every page that prints has a noticable mark running about every three inches, 1-1/2 inches in from the right side.  I was hoping it would fade after a few prints but it will not go away. So I went to the Panasonic support website and left an email about the problem. They responded that they did not support this unit and that I should call a Panasonic support phone number.  The automated reply at this number did not recognize this model and terminated the call.  I went back to the website and they gave me another number for an overseas support site.  I was told that they did not support this type of equipment.  They gave me another number for support in New Jersey.  They also did not support the printer and forwarded me twice whereupon I was disconnected. I called the number agin and was given an email address of a support supervisor.  They never responded.  Last week I called yet another number and to my surprise they said they did support the printer.  They listed to my complaint and had me fax a copy of a printout to them.  They said they would respond.  They did not.  I called again today and was told that the print drum is defective, has a scratch on it and the mark will not go away without replacement of the drum.  And by the way, this is not covered by the warranty.  He said he would connect me with a supervisor and I was again disconnected.  Here's the special part...The warranty for the Laser Multi Function printer is 1 year for parts and 1 year for labor...but that excludes toner cartridge, drum unit and cosmetic parts (cabinet).  So what does this really mean.  The unit is now selling at Amazon for $200.  The best price for a drum at Amazon today is $133.76 (free shipping).  The best price for a toner cartridge (with shipping) is $57.95.  That amounts to 96% fo the cost of the entire printer, leaving a respectable $8.29 for the unwarranted cabinet.  So while they advertise a 1 year warrantee for parts and labor, it appears that it doesn't acutally cover anything.  So in summary, this is not the printer to purchase if you are looking for a quality printer and a company that will stand behind their product.  In fairness, although the elusive support team could offer no relief for this defective printer, they were polite.  So the next big question is: should I risk another $134 for a new drum with the possibility that their quality control is no better on the next drum than it was on the first one?

When I called the company for a replacement, I reached an automated system directing me to press 3 if I had destroyed my pen by tossing it into a fire, hoping it would regenerate like a genuine Phoenix pen.

Mistake.  I had faith in the robust design of HP printers and figured my engineering background and years of experience working with printers and networking products, including wireless, would overcome any shoddy documentation.  And the documentation was shoddy-- well below what I have come to expect from HP.  Despite the documentation, I did get it to work-- sort of.It ""sort of"" works because the killer flaw with this product is the way communication with the printer would mysteriously hang and ruin multi-page printouts.  I love the HP 460 printer driver's support for two-sided printing, but when you're in the middle of the back sides of 12 pages and the job hangs, there's nothing to do but start over-- lots of wasted paper, ink, and time.  Life's too short for this kind of time-eating hassle.  (I did a fairly sophisticated Wi-Fi site survey to make sure the 802.11 channels used in the ad-hoc connection were clear; regardless, with a reliable link such as TCP/IP supports, a well-designed product would simply wait for any RF interference to clear and then resume printing.  This product would repeatedly hang--just stop printing-- at random points during various print jobs.)  Please, HP, do everyone a favor and finish this product's software/firmware.Once I stopped using this wireless card and went back to using the alternative (hard-wired) USB connection, I couldn't believe how much I liked the printer again.  (I am an admitted longtime fan of HP printers.) Using the USB cable, the printer shoots out pages 2-3 times faster than when using this Wi-Fi card, and best of all, it NEVER hangs.  Ahhhhh.I don't know if the Bluetooth card works reliably, but this Wi-Fi card doesn't.  The Bluetooth wireless option is almost certainly slower than this Wireless-G card, so the USB cable may still be a better option unless you really *need* a wireless connection (or don't have a free USB port).  Also, note that if you use the USB cable, you can keep your laptop's Wi-Fi (Wireless-B/G) linked to an Internet access point instead of devoting it to the printer link.",1,Product not ready for consumers,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",369,13,13,1,helpful

People on the other end sound gravelly and somewhat muffled, so much so that I often have to ask them to repeat something they've said.

He was intrigued with his new gadget and how well it scanned and organized business cards into Outlook and ACT!, and did so without any third party application needed.Was impressed, but felt that a business card scanner, though handy, was too limiting for my personal needs, so I took a further look that the products from The Neat Company, and the NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner is one of the models that I found. Like my colleague's new tech gadget, I can scan business cards, but with this model I can scan receipts and documents. Have found that this mobile scanner does a good job scanning even wrinkled receipts that can be exported into Excel and Quicken, and scanning documents that can be exported into searchable PDF files is easy with the supplied NeatWorks 4.0 software.&#9670; Pros:+ Lightweight and compact, weighs less than a pound.+ Fits easily into a notebook or laptop computer case.+ Scans and exports documents into searchable PDF files.+ No external power needed, powered by USB cable (included).+ Performs its scans quickly.&#9670; Cons:- No cons found originally, but see the update below.As an added bonus, found that images can be saved in JPG format, which is a handy plus point for this reviewer, especially when going through old family photos. It also does a good job scanning old magazine advertisements into PDF and JPG formats.Also available for as an option for this scanner is a well-madeTravel Case for NeatCo Mobile Scannersin black. It's worth considering if you want to keep your scanner and USB cable in a convenient place in about any notebook computer case.&#9670; Summary:Have barely scratched the surface regarding the capabilities of this very handy mobile scanner, and am impressed so far by the capabilities of the NeatWorks 4.0 software. This product isn't one that might appeal to all, but if you're looking for a functional and highly versatile computer accessory that's a time-saving device when it comes to dealing with getting loose receipts scanned into Excel, TurboTax, Quicken or QuickBooks, then this is well worth considering.&#9670; [Updated 3/2/2014]Maybe I should have no complaints as this scanner has been in service since 2009, but I have lowered my 'highly recommended' rating of this product to a 3-star recommendation. There have been increasing issues over the last year with the way that this scanner 'pulls' paper, and it has gotten worse. Since this scanner was picked up, it has been used with my Windows 7 notebook and with my Windows 8.1 notebook, and it has become twitchy with both. The biggest disappointment has been with my MacBook Pro, now running Mavericks (OS X 10.9.x), and it's performance has been substandard.Should note that my newerEpson WorkForce DS-30 Portable Document Scanner, though originally not as good, has been performing far more reliably than this NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner, especially after a few free software upgrades on both the Mac and the Windows PCs. Have needed to update my review on that Epson product since it was originally posted, and though not perfect, it is far more reliable than the one in my original review above.This is not some random rant, and I've held back for over 18 months posting this update, but it appears that others have had similar problems with this product.

After carefully following the setup instructions and the trouble shooting instructions Canon customer service was called.  After repeating the trouble shooting steps with the service technician he came to the conclusion that the print head was faulty and sent out a new print head at no cost.  After installing the new print head, the printer still would not print. A second call to the  Canon technical service number and repeating all the trouble shooting steps led to the conclusion that the printer was faulty.  A brand new printer was sent out with instructrucions for the exchange of the faulty original at no cost to me.  The new printer worked as expected and the faulty printer was returned with a prepaid shipping label.Although the printer is described as a photo printer I use it as a black and white text printer as I have an Epson photo printer dedicated to that task.  The first copy that the printer makes is slow to be printed as the printer must go through all the preliminary steps of priming and charging the color nozzles of each ink color (there are 5 ink color cartridges) prior to printing. Because of this step there is ink usage of all the color cartridges even though the text printing of documents uses black ink only. The ink cartridges have chips which estimate the  ink useage of each cartridge and if the chip estimates that one color is empty (even though it may not be) the printer will not work until that cartridge is replaced.  The branded ink cartridges are expensive relative to the cost of the printer. The printer documentation warns that any damage caused by using non-manufacturer branded ink cartridges will void the warranty (it is illegal under U.S. law to outright prohibit the use of non-manufacturer branded ink cartridges in order to obtain warranty service).

Have been working with the machine perched on my desktop tower case.Mostly works like a champ.  Once you learn the software and get it configured for what you are doing, you put in a stack of sheets and push the button and (except for problems noted below) you come back several minutes later and you have a PDF with the scanned images of the pages with searchable text.The caveats are as follows:While regular printer/copier paper rarely misfeeds, notebook paper sometimes has problems with more that one sheet being grabbed at a time.In cases where the pages had been torn at perforations (think old tractor feed paper) sometimes the scanner will get partway through a job and then can't get the next sheet to feed without some help from the user.The out tray has an upwards curvature in it which can make a feeding sheet push around the top sheet in the output tray.  Sometimes a previous page gets dumped on the floor and the rest of the output stack is usually a bit disheveled.  This more of a problem with wrinkled, torn or hole punched sheets than with sheets in good condition.On the input tray the adjustable side guides do not go up far enough.  With a large stack of paper some sheets will start feeding slightly askew but then straighten out gradually as they feed.  The result is a scanned image that has a slight curvature in the image.  Cutting down on how many pages in a stack and vigilance on checking the guides to eliminate slop helps a lot.Have had a few problems with driver seeming to freeze.  Cycling the scanner power usually un-seizes things.A magazine review claimed that the scanner included OmniPage Pro 14, however, mine was shipped with Omnipage Pro 12.  OCR accuracy seems pretty good but of couple of options that the scanner owners manual describes as appearing in certain dialog boxes simply aren't there on my computer.There's a bit of a learning curve for the included software.  The front end they created to simplify managing scanning and OCR has a decent amount of power but the interface seems a bit clunky to me for anyone who wants customize for a wide variety of paper sizes and contrasts.On an X2 4200+ machine scanning at 200 dpi on both sides of page the OCR did not keep up with scanning and the front end does not appear to allow new scan to start till OCR is fully completed with previous batch of sheets so I could not keep the scanner more than perhaps 50% active.If it had shipped with OmniPage Pro 14, I would have given it 4 stars.",3,Documate 152 - Small and mostly good at what its designed for,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",465,23,24,0.958333333,helpful

The driver installation is funky. When you load the driver CD, it asks you if you want to install the USB driver or the network driver. My recommendation to you is to install the network driver. Why? Because it ALSO installs the USB driver first. So if you install the USB driver first and then go back in and install the network driver, it reinstalls the USB driver before installing the network driver. A big waste of time.2.) After the network driver is installed, the software spends a good minute looking for the printer over the Ethernet connection before checking for it over wifi. There should be an option to just search over wifi, since I connected mine that way and worried the software install had crashed because it took so long before letting me do anything!3.) Turning off the printer is not a one-button affair. It always asks you some fax-related question, which I've thus far not been able to figure out how to disable....But what about the printer?As others have stated, it's a very good all-in-one. However I've personally never been a fan of memory card slots on the front of printers as I prefer to edit my photos and then print from a computer. For the older, less tech savvy folks, the memory card slots feature is quite useful I'm sure. Different strokes!Print quality is very good. I've no complaints here. For the money this is a very good printer. Wifi printing worked perfectly for me after the software installation, and I had no trouble connecting the printer to my hidden wireless network with encryption. The printer supports WEP encryption, WPA, WPA2 etc. All bases covered.Overall, another fine effort from Epson in the ""general purpose"" printer area. Nothing stands out as amazing or terrible.

I have always been favorably impressed by Cross pens as they have withstood heavy use and at times when I was in college, even abuse.  Therefore, when I was looking for a nice entry level pen to try out newer fountain pens (in addition to the fountain pens I inherited), I turned to the Cross Century II, as it seemed to be a nice pen at an entry level price.  While the pen writes nice and is able to flow smoothly with almost all inks, the overall quality of the pen was disappointing.  I now have had this pen for a couple of months and it is not the quality of pen I was expecting from Cross.The biggest detraction was that after two days of use, the gold plating started to come off all over the pen.  I am an attorney, so I do write frequently, but after two days of use, this should not have happened.  On my previous Cross pens (I have owned about a dozen), this happened only after years of use.  In comparing my previous Cross pens to this Cross pen, I noticed that the gold plating seems to be much thinner on this Cross pen.  I also noticed that on this pen, the surface to which the gold was applied seems to be a much smoother chrome surface, making it more difficult for the gold to stick for a long period of time.  In contacting Cross, plating wear or pealing of the gold plating is not covered on warranty, no matter how long you have the pen. After two months of use, the pen looks to have Chrome accents with speckled areas of gold.  I use this to write in my office, but not in front of clients because it now looks like a cheap pen.I enjoy quality products wherever they are made (including now my large collection of Watermen fountain pens and other pens made in Europe purchased since I bought this pen).  Although this may not be the reason for the decline in quality of Cross pens, it is important to note that this Cross pen was made in China.  All my previous Cross pens have been made in the United States, so it was a disappointment to learn upon receiving this pen that it was made in China.  I didn't know at the time of ordering, but now after some additional research I learned that Cross has recently moved all production of their pens to China.  When I ordered this pen, I believed it was made in the United States as nothing on any web page of Cross or any product page at Amazon mentioned that the Cross pens were now made in China.After using a variety of fountain pens, the nib used on the pen is very nice.  The gold plating on the Nib has not pealed off, unlike the other gold accents on the pen.  I believe that Cross does not make the nib, and have heard (unverified) that the nib is made by Pelikan.  Maybe this is why the nib is the best feature on the pen.  For the fountain pen lovers, the nib is a very stiff nib and barely flexes.  However, for those pen users who are accustomed to the heavier writing pressure used with ball point pens and want to try fountain pens, this nib may be a good starting point.I would not purchase this product again.  Gold plating should not peel after two days of use.",3,Pen writes nice but quality is down,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",604,18,18,1,helpful

Well, I was in Office Depot and getting ready to buy a $[...]dollar package of cartridges (4 cartridges) and went over to look at the laser offerings.  I really like lasers but wanted a color laser and REALLY wanted a wireless version.  Was looking at the HP's but they were $$ when I saw the Brother HL-3070CW. (*Technical note: the Brother is not actually a laser but uses LED technology.  I came across this fact in a review site in the UK.  They say that this technology might actually be more accurate than the laser technology.  Hope I got that right.) It was everything I was looking for and more...it was Mac friendly!  Office Depot was selling them on sale for $[...] + tax.  I put back my ink jet cartridges and went home and started searching the net for reviews.  Well, it's a pretty new printer so not a lot out there but places I read said that it was a good home solution.  Went to Amazon and of course they had it and the reviews were good.  Oh yes, Amazon's price was $[...]and free shipping ( it is free standard shipping but I took them up on their Prime trial membership so I would get it in 2 days...pretty sweet) and of course no tax.  I figure I save about $[...] by buying from Amazon and of course there is the $[...] I saved by not buying replacement ink jet cartridges so my price came down to $[...].  Yeah, I know a bit of rationalization there but hey.  Well, UPS came 2 days later and I was in business.  First, the unit is very well packaged.  Oh yeah it's heavy too....49lbs I believe.  Notes: it comes with ""starter"" cartridges.  They get you going but don't have as much toner as a replacement cartridge.  Still I think they have a lot of life.  Also, no usb cord if you are going to go that route but I bought it specifically for wireless so no biggie.  It does come with an install disc that has both Windoze and Mac drivers along with the complete manual.  The quick setup guide also includes directions for setting up in both environments.  Hooray for Brother!  I was excited about getting this thing up and running but after looking at the quick start guide reference to wireless setup I stopped and thought to myself, ""eeeewwww, this may be harder than I thought"".  Well, I did some ""R&D;"" (that's Research and Delay) but came back to it a day or so later when I had some time and the house was quiet.  I followed the quick start guide and their recommended method of setting up the wireless connection.....ethernet connection (yes, you need your own ethernet cord as the unit does not come with one) from the Brother to your router and install through wireless computer (old G5 in my case).  Directions were clear and was able to get up and running in very little time and the ""first"" time.  I believe that other reviewers have said that this was not clear and/or a bit difficult.  I had no problems you just have to know what kind of security you have on your router, and basically the password.  If your router supports ""AOSS"", ""Wi-Fi Protected Setup"", or ""Secure Easy Setup"", things are probably even easier.  Installed the drivers on both my G5 and wife's iBook and everything worked!  This doesn't happen to me very often so I was overjoyed.  My wife is loving this printer.  She's out in the living room and hit's ""print"" and the Brother wakes up and starts printing.  Print speed is quite sufficient for our needs.  Quality seems very good.  We've only printed out documents with color printing and everything is very crisp.  When you first install it you can print out a demo page that is just awesome!  One thing you might want to remember is paper.  Brother recommends laser paper that is 20-24lbs.  Think I'm using some copy paper that is 20lbs and think my next purchase will be 24lbs paper.  The unit holds 250 sheets in a paper tray below and has the ability to print envelopes and other stuff using a straight through path.Lastly, everything I've read indicates that the cost of ownership of a laser is better than an ink jet so that's a plus.  Print quality is top notch.  Wireless is the way to go.....happy happy.  I'd heartily recommend this printer to friends and even family.  GO FOR IT!28 Aug 10  ......UpdateJust wanted to add that this printer is playing well with a bevy of new laptops.  My eldest son when home from UGA (GO DAWGS!) connects up wirelessly with his Lenovo laptop (Win 7).  My wife's ancient iBook died a couple of months ago and was replaced with an ASUS UL50Vt-A1 running Win 7.  Connection was easy and it works great.  I recently purchased a Sony VAIO VF111FX/B running Win 7 and it too was a piece of cake to get up and print wirelessly. NOW, I'm at the stage where I'm looking at replacement toner cartridges to replace the ""starter"" cartridges.  Be very careful when ordering and don't be confused between toner and drums.  Amazon has a four pack of drums but you'll need toner before you buy drums so be careful and order correctly.

If you aren't familiar with the Aeron chair you just have to take it on faith that it is not like anything else.  It is so good in so many ways that you can't really appreciate it until you have one of your own.Unfortunately for me the seat on this one was not as deep as my older one was so the front of the seat put too much pressure on the back of my legs and I had to send it back.  I'm 6' 6"" tall so I don't expect this to be a problem for many people.  However, this chair comes in three sizes and you need to make sure you get the size that works for you.  They don't fit everyone.  The importance of this review is the return experience.  In short, this vendor took back the chair but charged me over $170 to restock, plus return shipping!  That is just too much.  While I think this is a great chair if it fits you, you can't really afford the price of returning it if it turns out not to be for you.The lesson is to only buy from this vendor online if you are 100% sure you are going to like it.  I'm personally so upset by being gouged on the return I will never buy from this vendor again.  I recommend you think twice before buying and then think again.  You can get this chair a lot of other places for a good price without the chance of being gouged if you need to return it. If they treat you this way on a return it probably says a lot about what to expect if you need any other customer service.  I would stay away from this vendor, you can definitely do better some place else.Did I say I was upset by this?  This is also a lesson about buying on Amazon in general.  Not all vendors are equal.  Amazon as the vendor has always done me right but they should not let this kind of thing happen on their site.  They share part of the blame.UPDATE NEXT DAY:I received an email last night from Amazon after making this review.  They refunded my restock fee!  They deserve a lot of credit for stepping in and making this right.  I was an early Amazon user before they were even profitable.  They have never let me down.  This type of service is why I look forward to remaining a study and loyal Amazon customer.  That is just great customer service by Amazon.

It does look a bit more like one of HP's cheapie inkjet or photo printers than the serious B&W; laser workhorse that it is.It's chintzy-appearing plastic paper tray sticking out of the front and it's very inexpensive price (...) belies its rather impressive capabilities as a reasonably ""heavy duty"" home office or small business printer.I'm a full-time, home-based medical transcriptionist. My printer output averages 5,000-7,500 pages a month -- a much higher output demand than most home offices and others who have posted reviews here. Because I work on production, I absolutely require a reliable laser printer.The reason that I bought the HP 1300 was because a Brother HL-5140 I had recently purchased turned out to be entirely unsatisfactory after only a couple months of use (it's poorly designed and plagued with paper jams). I knew I should have stuck with HP in the first place.I have now used the HP 1300 for about a month and printed more than 5,000 pages without a single glitch or paper jam. Yes, I am very careful about how I handle the paper I put into the printer, but I think that's pretty amazing. And after printing more than 5,000 pages with the small-capacity 13A toner cartridge (which is rated at 2,500 pages), I still have 25% of the toner left.Over the past years I have used LaserJet 4L and 6P models extensively. The only differences I can discern between them and the current printer is that he HP 1300 is quieter and a whole lot faster. And, contrary to the observations of some reviewers here, I have found the print quality among all three to be consistenly excellent.I don't give a 5-star rating easily, but the HP 1300 has earned it.THE PROS:1.  Initial setup (at least for me, using a parallel port connection with both DOS and Windows drivers) was incredibly quick and simple. Anyone who has trouble installing this printer (as mentioned in a couple of other reviews here) probably didn't bother to read the instructions.2.  I found the online documentation to be quite adequate, and the online ""Toolbox"" is an extremely useful tool for both customizing the printer and monitoring its current status.3.  If output speed is what you're looking for, the HP 1300 delivers with HP's ""instant-on fuser technology."" No more waiting for the laser printer to warm up between jobs. For me, this ""first page out"" time is as important as the rated print speed.4.  Paper of all kinds, including envelopes, run through it without any problems, and the print quality is excellent.5.  It's about as quiet as any laser printer I've ever used.6.  The HP 1300 appears to be VERY well designed and built for very hard use. Changing the toner cartridge couldn't be easier.THE CONS:1.  I remains to be seen if the HP 1300 will stand up to my very rigorous use as well as my old LaserJet 6P, which has over 120,000 pages through it and is still going strong.2.  As noted by another reviewer, like nearly all laser printers, it does tend to curl the top and bottom edges of the printed pages a bit sometimes, which can be a bit annoying. However, this characteristic is common to nearly all laser printers, and it depends a lot on temperature, humidity, and the type of paper you're using.All in all, an absolutely fantastic, reasonably heavy-duty printer, and a terrific bargain for(...).Bob",5,Don't be fooled ...,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",577,26,26,1,helpful

Fax and copy also work well. Over the years, I have used numerous dot matrix, inkjet, mono laser and color laser printers - including  Dell 5100cn andBrother MFC-9840CDW Color Laser Multifunction Center with Wireless Interface and Duplexand this is the best print quality I have seen. It even printed the custom A4 size notebook paper forLivescribe 4 GB Echo Smartpenwhich prints on very few PostScript laser color printers.But everything else about this multifunction machine left a lot to be desired.The brand new printer came with three defects: 1). The front access panel did not close in a new machine. Replacement front door sent by Minolta was worse, we had to hold it with a tape! 2). There were smudges on one side of the page.  3). Background printed a reticular sort of pattern. Adorama, from whom I purchased this has very limited hours, they do not answer calls after 1 PM on Friday until Monday morning.The documentation that came this machine wass VERY POOR. There was one installation guide with all cartoons but no text! No Quick setup guide either. The quick reference card has color cartoons, no text. But there is multi page legal jargon text Safety Guide!What you need to read - like how to install and use the machine -is not there: and what you don't read - legal safety jargon & how not to use the machine - has multiple pages. HOW LOONY?But if you have worked with these kind of machines, you know where the power cord goes and where the network cable goes etc. So you can figure that part out. The network installation was easy on the Windows XP but not on Mac. I could not get it to install on Mac. It boggles my mind that they would build a machine with excellent print engine and yet have such poor quality in everything else like documentation, software, finish, construction and support etc.Integrating all the multiple functions and features into a unified software is probably very hard and i have used HP, Dell, Brother, Samsung and Canon multifunction machines. The only company that has nailed the software part is Canon. They have beautifully integrated faxing, scanning, printing, and copying inCanon Pixma MX310 Office All-in-One Inkjet Printer (2184B002). Unfortunately, Canon does not make commercial grade color laser printers.Printing, faxing and copying work fast on this Minolta Magicolor 4695F but I was not able to get the scanner part to work. Finally Minolta sent a service technician to my office and he said the front access panel could not be closed because of twisted latch, smudges on the side were due to a torn belt and the background noise in print was due to heat problems. He blamed all the defects on reseller Adorama or shipper UPS and said one of them had dropped the printer somewhere and ruined it. Adorama said that Minolta printers have very high defect rate and almost 20% were returned! Of course, I was one of those 20% and returned the machine to Adorama.Would you really want to buy a multifunction machine with 20% defect rate?",3,"Good Print Quality But Flimsy Construction, Manufacturing Defects & Poor Documentation",1287187200,"10 16, 2010",541,9,10,0.9,helpful

The case itself, for the packaging that these come in, isn't going to last you longer than the markers will, as far as durability is concerned, but it is smartly designed so that it holds the markers in place without them shifting around on you. So, first star for BIC.The markers themselves have a nice range of colors, and, cutesy names notwithstanding, each one does actually give you a different shade or hue from the others. There are no colors fully repeated here, just a nice, wide range of permanent colors. The caps give you an idea of what colors are enclosed within, but, being an artist myself, I've had way too many experiences where the encasing material just can't seem to be produced in a color close enough to give you a real idea of what the particular medium will produce, so a self-made color chart is always the safest way to go, in my opinion.I've only just started using these markers, and the project I'm currently using them on doesn't necessarily require the use of permanent ink, but in order to not have to worry about the ink running, I decided to use these markers in lieu of standard water-based markers, which makes me feel secure that the art that I'm creating won't be destroyed by drips of water. The colors in this set are really beautiful, and have reliably complemented every piece of craft or construction paper that I've applied them to to make my ocean scene.So far, I couldn't be happier with the results that I've gotten from these markers. The fine tip gives me a fine enough line for small details, while I'm able to get an adequately wide fill area by using the side of the same tip to color in larger, wider swaths of my work. I thought for sure that Sharpie was going to be the only brand that I gave my heart to, but BIC is stepping up to the plate here as a more than adequate competitor!

I went through all the trouble shooting options with no luck and thought to myself what a nightmare!So knowing that I was not going to get any help from a 19 yr old Phillipino that barely speaks English I hunted down the Epson corporate offices in Long Beach CA and gave them a call. Where do those calls get routed? You guessed it! The Philippines and they of-course directed me to the support specialists lol now I don't use the scanner daily but rather weekly so they said I had to take the scanner out for repair and the closest place was an hour from my office. So I called made an appointment and took the scanner for a nice ride in LA traffic.It's been there for two weeks now and they are waiting for a new ""main board"" to see if that's the problem? I'm sure in the next week or so I'll be spending another couple of hours on the road for the sake of my new Epson Scanner!So $400.00 8 weeks down the road and I still can't scan.

I had long been a fan of Epson products and had found them to be of good quality with excellent tech support. The scanner that I received was apparently defective and when I called Epson, I reached someone who appeared to be an outsourced tech limited to the information that she could read from a script. She was rude and insisted that it was not an issue with the scanner...that it isn't possible for the scanner equipment to be defective. I reached no resolution with her. I contacted Epson with my concerns, but received no response. Fortunately for me, the store where I purchased the scanner was very accomodating and we arranged for a return/replacement. The machine that replaced the original DOES WORK, consequently confirming that it was NOT a software issue. Epson...what happened to your formerly excellent technical service?

Printer was pretty slow and noisy but worked fine so far. Then I sent to it a 4x6 photograph and got the familiar and popular error saying that ""the print head is missing or needs to be replaced"". After reinstalling the print head over and over as suggested by the diagnostic message, I gave up after loosing 4 hrs of my life. Next day, I called the Customer Support at Kodak. The person with a very high level of certainty diagnosed my issue as a 'faulty print head' - seemingly a very popular cause with this printer. The print head was to arrive overnight - It arrived 3 days later. Replacing the head did not help. So, I went to the Kodak website and learned that there is a new firmware for this printer. After uploading the new firmware to the printer it went dumb. It was spitting out two sheets and then wrinkling up and spitting out more pages. No way to stop it except pulling the plug. So, I did. Next day, convinced that it must be an isolated issue, I went to Best Buy to replace the printer. I went through the exact same initial steps again and even got further this time. I was able to print 8 4x6 color photos in the ""Best"" mode, which looked pretty good as far as color saturation, but were a bit skewed. They also used up close to 50% of my color ink cartridge! So, I estimate that I can get probably only about 20-25 such prints out of a full color ink cartridge, which is much much less than the advertised 35. Then I tried the double sided print from a network computer and found out that the duplex option is disabled on every computer except the one to which the printer is physically connected. This is of course not advertised anywhere. So, I decided to test the double sided printing on the host. It was sloooooooooooow and not printing out a large part of the top of the page. So, I said to my self - Ok, there must surely be a good reason for the new firmware to be offered on Kodak's website. So, I uploaded it again and...the printer went dumb again...I actually read the reviews on Amazon and still decided to give this printer a try ""because it looked sooo nice and offered sooo much"". I said to myself, what the heck - I am a pretty savvy techie  - I can certainly do better than these ""Amazon amateurs"". Well, now I am joining what actually turned out to be a pretty wise Amazon crowd with my tail and ears curled all the way down in my disappointment.Next day, I returned the second printer and am sticking to my old Lexmark for time being.Kodak 5500 and especially its software and firmware are of poor quality. Endless errors, less than ideal prints, DON'T BUY. Consider yourself warned.And...please read more interesting reviews of its sibling - the 5300 series.One more thing - ""friendly Kodak guy"".

The printer is now recognizing the router.Edited to add 11/03/11: I've just recently got Verizon Fios for internet, phone and TV and I've noticed that my printer is now having a hard time maintaining a connection to the Verizon Fios router.  I print strictly over Wi-Fi and since my Verizon services have been installed, my printer seems to hate Verizon LOL. I reset all the settings but I've still been having issues.  I'm currently trying to get the kinks worked out.Edited to add 08/08/11: This printer keeps getting better and better! I've tested the SD card and it's an awesome feature to have! I have been able to pull my SD card out of my camera and stick it in the printer and print photos from the SD card. I have also been able to print directly from my thumb drive. I can't say enough good things about this printer because it has made my life so much easier! I also wanted to let any iPad2 owners out there know that I also got the free Canon iEPP App from the Apple AppStore and have been using the app to scan directly to my iPad! What you do is place whatever document or photo you want to scan on the printer, then you hit scan on the app and the program will tell the printer to scan wirelessly! Your document will then show up in the app on the iPad where you can then email it, upload it to a cloud based service such as Dropbox or export it to Photos or an app such as GoodReader etc.  The cloud based services are integrated within the app. You can also do some editing to your document within the application. This printer rocks!Edited to add 06/18/11: I have also been using this printer to print wirelessly from my iPad 2. If you don't have a HP compatible printer for Apple's Air print IOS feature, then this printer will work with the use of a printer application from the Appstore. I use Printcentral and it works flawlessly with this Canon printer!I have gone through several printers over the past few years because they usually just completely die on us. I do a lot of graphic design and photo printing so we use our printer a lot in our home. I've purchased all in one printers in the past and haven't had much success with them so I've just been purchasing the equipment that I need individually such as the scanner and fax. We needed another printer in our home to go along with the one we currently have so I decided to once again give the all in one printer another chance and I'm so glad that I did!  This Canon printer is absolutely amazing.  The setup is fairly easy if you're good at following directions. It took me about an hour to get everything setup and working properly.I've tested just about every feature except the use of a SD card.  I haven't installed a SD card yet but will soon. The printer's scanner feature works really well. I scanned some photos and an ID card and each item scanned with perfection and clarity. I tested the printer's copy feature and let me tell you that the quality of the copies were outstanding.  The copies looked exactly like the originals. The copies were so detailed that a staple was copied on the paper and it looked like the actual staple was still in the paper!  I was amazed at the quality of the scanned photos even the color prints came out with HD quality. The printer is hooked up to my phone line so that I'm able to fax so I haven't had any issues with the fax feature.I love the color LCD screen especially all of the user-friendly menus.  I was able to get the Wi-Fi setup fairly easily.  I have two Wi-Fi connections in my home. One of my connections is through a Verizon hotspot that we've purchased and the other is coming through our wireless router and I was able to add both access points to the printer and toggle between the both of them. I like the fact that the printer makes it easy for you to connect to either one. The only thing that I've noticed so far is that the prints may come out a little slow sometimes but that may depend on whether on not you're printing by USB or Wi-Fi. I print only over Wi-Fi so I guess it all depends on how fast my network is going at the moment. This is an excellent printer for any home office and I highly recommend it. I will be purchasing Canon printers for now on in the future. I'm so done with Lexmark and HP printers!Pros:Fairly easy to setup, HD quality prints and copies and excellent scanner.  The fax feature is awesome! You're able to install a SD card and the printer has a port for a portable flash drive which makes it easy to load photos from a thumb drive. You're also able to connect your camera directly to the printer to print that way as well. I also like the fact that the print door opens automatically if it's closed when there's a job sent to the printer. This is a nice little feature. No USB cable is needed to setup the printer.  It came be done completely over Wi-Fi.Cons:The printer has a tendency to print slow depending on the network connection. I also tested the printer by plugging my printer directly to my laptop using a USB cable which made it print a tad bit faster. The printer also doesn't come with a USB cable.

The first was a cheap Mustek scanner that I bought because it was &quot;middle of the line&quot;, not  because it was great.  That was a mistake.  Scanning took forever, and the  quality was only average.  There also was a bug in the scanner software  which caused crashing...Luckily my old scanner broke after a year or two  and I was forced to look to the market again for another one.  This time I  was fed up with looking for  a &quot;deal&quot;, and proceeded to look for  quality.  I bought a well known PC magazine and looked at the ratings.

730352,A18U9BQQQ0U8F5,B003SX0QZK,Grieger,"[16, 16]","I thought I'd try the Panasonic multi-function printer since I figured it might help me in my home office. I've only really got a printer so the idea of having a scanner, copier and fax machine I could use for basic tasks sounded good to me. I'll break this down by task/feature.SetupThe printer was real easy to set up. Plug in a phone line, plug in a network cable (I'm using it on my home network) and plug in power. Install software. Done. The software isn't even really required. Now, the downside is, if you're looking to plug this into your computer because you honestly are just using it on one machine and don't really have a network setup then you're out of luck. It's got a USB port so you can do just that (plug it into your computer directly) but it doesn't come in the box. You have to go get one yourself. Not nice in my opinion. It's one thing to say ""Network Ready"" and another thing entirely to be ""Network Required"". That being said, you still can use it as a printer, copier and fax machine if you don't plug it into anything except the phone line.One other thing to note, the printer cartridge included in the package comes in two parts. One smaller part fits into a slot in the bigger cartridge (with the ink) and needs to be opened (you rotate a drum that presumably exposes the print head to the incoming paper). I'm a big and strong guy and I had a whole lot of fun trying to get that drum rotated during the setup. Granted I was afraid I'd break it but the piece you're pushing against is pretty solid plastic. It was more about how much resistance there was there. It's possible it was just a freak thing with my cartridge but you'd think it would either be easier or not require you to assemble the cartridge in the first place (my other laser printer has one cartridge).PrinterAs a printer, the Panasonic is pretty straightforward. I think the best part of it is that it's a laser printer. I'd always been used to seeing inkjet versions of these multi-function printers which has turned me off. It supports up to 600 dpi print outs with decent results. I did have some trouble getting the printer set up in Windows (using Win 7 64-bit) as the installer installed a printer in Windows that didn't seem to go anywhere. You could print to it but the documents just disappeared in to the ether. I deleted that and reinstalled the printer (just using the built-in/available driver that Windows offered which could still be the same drivers) and it worked great. It can push out 24 ppm and though I didn't run a speed test to check this out (not gonna waste paper on that...I don't print that much in a week) what I did print out came out in a snap.ScannerI was really looking forward to the scanner part since I have a more ""pro"" scanner but it's largely mothballed so it's a hassle to break it out to do any scanning. It was real easy to run a scan though the results are a bit iffy. For most documents, it was just fine. Scans were clean enough on regular paper. But, when I used paper that had even a slight gloss to it (I'm not talking magazine gloss, I'm talking matte coated paper), I'd get glare artifacts all over the place. Basically, the light from the scanner was (and I'm just theorizing here, not an expert) reflecting back enough to create something like a feedback loop. And, this didn't cover the entire page, just certain chunks of it. Even more odd was that the patterns, while consistent from scan to scan for the same document, were different from those when using the copy function. So, I can't say if this is a fault of the machine or the technology itself.The OCR software included with the printer is functional but nothing fancy. And when I say ""nothing fancy"", I mean it. The UI is incredibly retro (the software has a copyright of 2002). Whereas you'd expect to be able to use your mouse's scrollwheel to either scroll or zoom in/out, the app constrains you to set zoom levels (50% of actual, fit to window, etc.) and you have to click around between the horizontal and vertical scrollbars to get where you want to go. You can then use boxes (no magic wand or anything for you PhotoShop types) to define areas that have text, images, etc. It includes a feature that lets you edit the OCR's attempt at recognizing the word, number, punctuation though it can get tedious and the font they use to display the replacement character is terrible (sort of like a blobby Courier) to where you can't always be sure if you're looking at a zero versus an eight or a comma versus a period. The recognition itself is as good as the quality of the scan so your mileage will vary. Clean scans (non-glossy paper, straightforward fonts/text) work nearly perfect (line spacing might take a hit with a slightly misaligned original...especially since you can only rotate 90 degrees within the software). Anything else is a grab bag that usually results in missing sections or something that looks like a ransom note. If you really need OCR, you'll want to find something better.FaxAnother feature I was looking forward to. As much as faxing is on the decline (unless you're dealing with companies that really just don't trust online signatures for legal or other reasons), I still find myself wishing I had a fax handy at times. I usually end up heading to the Fedex store or letting my wife do it from work. By default, the fax feature is on and working. In my case, I don't have a dedicated fax line and I was only really planning on using this on an as needed basis. It took a sec to find the right place in the instructions to figure out the correct setting (in fact, the machine's own menu system had a print option to print a sheet of instructions related to that feature which helped the most). Once I did it though, I was golden. I faxed a doc off to someone (the one time I needed it in six months) and it went off without a hitch. They e-mailed me what they got as a PDF and it looked as good as you'd expect (it was an IRS form so text-dense, no graphics). Even better is the PC Fax feature which lets me ""print"" to the fax feature and fax something directly without having to print it out. The feature shows up as a printer and, when you print to it, prompts for a number to fax to--even offering a delayed send option so you can have it send out an hour later or something (say to avoid interfering with the phone during business hours). Very cool. The only down side is the software log that shows you sent and received faxes doesn't seem to retain those faxes despite setting it up NOT to delete sent faxes and the like.CopyThe copy feature is yet another function I've been wanting for a while. Of course, with a scanner, it's effectively a scan and a print but as I mentioned before, my scanner isn't exactly a convenient option. The copies worked well and, as you'd expect, are as fast as they can be with a fast scan and a 24 ppm printer. I didn't try a large copy job but I don't expect this thing to be some refrigerator-sized Xerox beast that churns out books in a few minutes. For the one-off copy, it works great.As mentioned above with the scanner, with certain paper types, you do see some artifacting but strangely the pattern is different from the scan. This could be because the copies are lower resolution than the scans (sort of a fast scan) so there's less opportunity for ""feedback"" from the light source but it's strange nonetheless. For the record, the copy scan looks better than the scan.ConclusionAll in all the product is good enough. I don't have a previous product that this is replacing (at least not one I've used in the past decade) so I can't really compare it to other products. But, if you're in the market for a multifunction printer that does it all and you aren't worried about the aforementioned scanning artifacting (i.e. it's not about the quality of the scans, just that you have a digital copy you can use), then go for it. The Panasonic includes all the features you'd expect but upgraded with tech that used to be only in dream machines that did just one thing. Just something about having one of these printers as a laser printer rather than an inkjet that seems to make it feel so much better than it used to be when buying one of these devices.",4,Just add a kitchen sink and you're done...,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",1513,16,16,1,helpful

Great features, very versatile and a super price. Hey, an *incredible* price for the features! (the instant warmup of the LED scanning lights alone is worth the price of admission if you've been scanning for years). And there are plenty of other reviews from people smarter than me that will give you loads of technical info about those areas.But are you looking to scan film?Did you just have the great idea...""Hey! I'm going to take all my old film and digitize it so I can burn a DVD/post it on my blog/etc.!""Well buckle up, my friend, it's going to be a bumpy ride. If you want to digitize the giant pile of 35mm negatives you have in your drawer let me ask YOU a few questions...Do you work at home?Do you have a *lot* of free time on your hands?Do you run 2 computers at the same time?Do you have ADD?If you answered yes, then your analogue past life is about to go digital. See...here's the thing...scanning negatives is s........l.........o..........w. And tedious. And low quality.NOTE: I have been taken to task for this last comment...apparently some folks think scans from their 35mm images are better than what they get in this digital age. Hundreds of slides and negatives later, I disagree.My experience (x 1,000) is that my 35mm negatives from the 70's and 80's are pretty sad compared to what you shot yesterday on your digital pocket camera. Sure, I shot plenty of grainy pix in poor light with ASA 200-400 film, but I also shot plenty of 100 speed. I use aPentax K20D 14.6MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction and DA 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL II Lenssaving images at 7-9 megs. I've found nothing from a 35mm slide or negative that holds a candle to that.Once I realized that my antique film medium itself is deficient, I stopped indulging myself in the fantasy that scanning at 9600dpi (extrapolated) is going to make a bit of difference. Slides and film just won't stand up to that. Hey...that's my experience anyhow.I ended up scanning at 1200 dpi. It takes 2 minutes per frame.If you're lucky, you'll have 6 frame strips and you can scan two strips at a time. That's 24 blissful minutes of peace. If you're not lucky (i.e. most of the time) the film strips are cut to 4 images. Two of those means 16 uninterrupted minutes.You cannot use your computer for ANYTHING else while scanning. NOTHING. Then you will have to change film strips every 16 minutes...or every 24 minutes. Take your pick. And get ready to be interrupted every 16-24 minutes until you've relived your life. (-:Got a 36 exposure roll to digitize? Have over an hour to kill with 3-5 interruptions? Don't need your computer for anything else while you're hovering (or you have a spare computer humming as you wait)?Then you're ready for the adventure of negative film or slide scanning.I'm not complaining, just reporting the facts. The alternative is to use a commercial service and pay around 50 cents per image. And if you think $18 is steep for the one *decent* frame off that roll of your trip to Thailand in 1991...I agree.Conclusion - This scanner is as good as it gets...in this price range.

I have had the unit for only two weeks but so far it has worked well with the exception that there are serious problems with the full version of the drivers, which tech support was not able to solve. (We concluded the tech support conversation with the agreement that I would reinstall the drivers and the tech would call me back to check on the results. However, I never received the return call.)Fortunately, HP offers a basic version of the drivers which, with one exception, has worked well. I tried the full version, after initially installing the basic version, because i concluded (incorrectly) that I needed the full version in order to get the help and manual features. The manual and help files can be installed by selecting Install More Software from the disk that comes with the unit.The problems with the full version drivers is complicated to explain but, in short, I was not able to print in draft mode.The one problem with the basic version involves printing a jpg or Corel PhotoPaint file that have been created in Corel PhotoPaint. In which case, they print at twice the normal size. I have not yet contacted HP technical service to help resolve this. Hopefully, they will have a solution. Note that photograph jpg files print without any problem.The printing quality of photos meets my requirements but they may not be as demanding as that of a photo enthusiast.One of the primary reasons for purchasing this product was that, from what little information I could find, it seemed to be relatively efficient as far as ink usage was concerned. It is always a challenge to quantity ink usage but so far it looks promising from that standpoint. I have printed about 20 4"" X6"" photos and about 20 B&W; text pages and the cartridges that came with the unit have about 80% of their initial quantity of ink left. Remember that the cartridges that come with the unit have significantly less ink than their replacements.I am hopeful that, in time, I will be able to give this a higher rating but the problems with the drivers, questionable tech support, and uncertainty about the ink usage dictate a 3 star rating for now.",3,"So far, so good",1329696000,"02 20, 2012",394,68,73,0.931506849,helpful

The biggest problems I see is the device for removing the label backing and the wasted tape. Removing the backing involves putting the label in a small slot and quickly pulling it out to get the ends to separate so that one can then peel the label from it's backing.  After using the initial roll of label tape, which is one half the amount of a regular roll (13' versus 26') it seemed the labels wouldn't separate.  I don't know if it's a tape problem or the device for separating the labels just sort of wears down.  Because you must put about 1/2"" of tape into this slot, they have to keep the ends of the tape - before and after the printed matter about 1/2"" long.  If you make short labels you end up wasting half your printer tape. I may take this thing back. It appears the whole concept of removing the tape was a rushed afterthought.Update: I eventually figured you can remove the labels by twisting the label as you pull it from the label backing remover slot.  Sometimes this slightly damages the label, but it is do-able. So I'll keep this thing. The label tape is cheaper than some of the other models as well.

If I sent them to a Lab, I could not be sure the order would be preserved. I looked at high speed scanners and could not find one with a review that did not include words like, jammed, dust, scratch, with a price tag of $2000.  This scanner was a fraction of that amount. I knew that this is a manual scanner. Meaning, you put four slides in at a time and move them through the scanner yourself.  Easy. Simple. It takes a little time to seat the slides properly, so the carrier slides through smoothly.  Each slide takes 3 seconds to sharpen.  But watching the detail sharpen on the led screen lets you know exactly how sharp your photo will scan.  AFTER it sharpens, you press Scan and then Save.  I didn't use my computer.  I used a 4G SD card.  This card can be used on any computer, and also sent to a photo service for a professional DVD copy.  I uploaded to a web album site, so my friend could share the photos.  I had 1256 slides to process, but with a simple manual scanner, you can stop any time. I did about 100 slides (45min) at a time and took a couple of weeks spending an hour a day at this task.

Each printhead has 2 colors assigned to it, and they are about $55.  Now you can also clean just one printhead instead of all 6 of them which saves ink. Left plugged in, the printer automatically runs a periodic nozzle cleaning with minimal waste to keep them clean.Color calibration is done with an i1 spectrophotometer for the material you are using.  Tell your software to let the printer manage color and send adobe rgb 1998 to it.  Then tell the printer it's getting adobe 1998 and it must mix and match.  It will take a little from each color to make [carl sagan on] billions of colors.The color gamut of this printer is only missing the metalics (a 13th cartridge would be too much), so you get accurate reproduction.  It also comes with a monitor calibration system so what you see is what you get across many media.The biggest surprise so far was the $1.28/sq ft matt universal canvas.  Go for heavy inking and you'd swear an artist slaved all day to render your 12 megapixel dslr raw digtital negative into a painting.  I have a roll of 24"" canvas loaded now and am going to try some art reproduction with it and a scanner.  You also have options to roll on clear sealer (acrylic) or use a brush and acrylic paints to turn the canvas into a real work of art.If 44"" and 12 inks isn't enough HP does make a 60"" carriage, but sacrificed the 12 inks down to 8.CONS:Here they are8"" of each roll is needed for each new load to do a color calibration (and 20 minutes give or take)high quality mode is slow as molassas to printinternal cutter can't cut canvas.Carriage may be 44"" but you have 6 bottles of ink on *each* side of that so the printer is wide.postscript rip is kinda on the slow side but the good news is it keeps the finished jobs in the printers hard disk until you delete them, so you can improve your media choices without another rip and just print.only has roll or sheetfeed - one sheet at a time.

I could not wait to get it. Boy was I disappointed. The scanner looks good but the software it comes with is pure junk. I first installed on a win98 machine which the cd claimed was supported. It would not work, javascript errors everytime. I installed on a 2nd XP computer and it worked without the javascript errors. I really needed it to work on my portable 98 system but at least I got it to work at all. I wanted to scan poster size artwork and re-assemble it using the arcsoft panorama software but it does not even work. I never could get it to go past the screen when you arrange your images. The hp scanning driver software is even worse, it will not remember your settings, you have to reload everytime, it closes when you scan from photoshop so you cannot scan multiple images without it taking 5 minutes each. If you scan using the hp software alone to get multiple scans it will autosave to jpegs(junkpegs to graphic artists) which are worthless to me. I need tiffs for the quality. There is no purpose in making a high resolution scan if it is going to be destroyed by saving to a jpeg. There is no option to change the filetype either. This software was clearly rushed to market with no thought as to how it would be used. I tried to get new software from hp's website but the links do not even work to download updated drivers for this scanner.

806890,AFRA6LGLFU7K,B004DKD7U8,Stephson,"[14, 14]","I ordered this nib on a whim after getting a Lamy Safari Fine-Point fountain pen. I liked the fine point, but I wanted a thicker nib that would give my writing more of a fountain pen look. Before the nib arrived, I got another Safari, this time a black one with a broad nib. The broad nib's writing is appealingly rounded, and definitely looks more like that of a fountain pen than the narrow nib's writing does. However, when I replaced the narrow nib with the 1.1mm nib (a process that took seconds and resulted in no spilled ink despite doing it with a full converter in the pen), I was amazed at the difference. This was what a fountain pen's writing should look like! It is clearer than the broad nib, and offers more line variation, making the writing look fancier and more fountain pen-like. Also, I have found that the broad nib has the tendency to thin inks out and make them lighter than they are in thinner nibs, but the 1.1mm nib wrote as darkly as my fine nib. As compared to the fine nib, the 1.1mm nib had the aforementioned advantages as well as smoother ink flow and, as a result, a more enjoyable writing experience. The price of $9 seems steep at first, given a Safari costs you $22-$25 dollars, and I was kicking myself for buying this nib after I got the broad nib pen. However, now that I have tried the new 1.1mm nib, I am so happy that I bought it! While no pen or nib will make your handwriting ""better"" (though I think that fountain pens do, a little), they can make it more fun, and make it easier to improve. This nib, and the Safari, make me love writing and make me eager to learn new styles of writing to move past my messy print. If you want to take your writing experience to the next level, get this nib. Trust me, you won't regret it.As a side-note, I have written with one or more of the nibs I have mentioned with the Lamy blue cartridges and black cartridges (which I wouldn't recommend), and with Noodler's Forest Green, Bulletproof Black, and Ottoman Azure bottled inks. The only ink I used with all three nibs was the Ottoman Azure, and so I based my review primarily on this ink.UPDATE 10/22I was tempted to say in the original review that the nib seemed like an italic, but, being new to fountain pens, didn't want to make such a declaration based on my own intuition. I have just confirmed, it is, in fact an italic nib, which explains why it is so much fun to write with. The one problem with it, however, is that because it doesn't have the bit sticking out on the bottom of the tip like the other Lamy nibs do, it is a lot harder to remove.

I feel that the Zadro wand is superior to other makes and models for the following reasons.  I like the fact that it opens to form a disinfecting area twice it's size.  This makes sanitizing large items/areas (beds, furniture, etc.) a lot easier and faster.  This wand emits UV A, B & C rays which makes the sanitizing process easier and quicker.  Because of this, there is no need to hold the wand over the area for a long time like with other models.  The 10 second timer is helpful for quick disinfecting, but you can also have the wand stay on in order to do larger items.  The wand charges quickly and the charge last a very long time. It does emit a bit of an ozone smell at times (I guess when it's actually killing bacteria, etc.) but it's not strong or unpleasant.  This makes me feel like it's doing it's job. I took this wand with me when I went out of town and stayed in a hotel.  With the rash of bed-bug problems being reported lately, I felt more at ease after ""wanding"" all bedding, the bathroom, TV remote, phone, alarm clock, etc.  The wand did seem to emit more of an ozone smell when I was doing the items at the hotel than what I experienced doing my items at home.  I was glad that I took it on the trip and it gave me peace of mind that I was being protected.  Lately, people at work are experiencing the flu.

When I contacted the comnpany the indicated that the repair parts for the old unit were no longer available.  I disassembled the old one, and, found out that it required only two nylon gears to put it back in running condition.  why the most critical parts of the machine were not made of more durable material defies common sense.  So much for repair, reuse, and recycle.Therefore, I was forced to buy a new machine.  I shopped around local big box stores, office supply shops, and the internet.  My finding was that although a few units were availalbe in local stores, the selection was usually quite limited.  That sense was magnified a hundred times when I began looking on the internet at all the units and manufactureres that produced shredders.  In the end, I decided to take the chance on another Fellowes machine, the 89ci which is a small business unit that I will use only in the home. It seemed to offer the best value of all the others I reviewed for the unse I intended it.I oped for a ""business strength"" unit for home use to potentially avert a recurrence of the failure with my former machine.  I was pleased with the way the 89ci was packed and shipped, and, it worked well right out of the box.  I did not find the paper tray included that was referred to in the packing list, but, I really don't need it anyway.  Also, the instruction sheet is marginal at best and fails to provide definite guidelines for how often to oil the unit.  (A number of internet articles suggest oiling at least each time you empty the bin.  The most practical advice on how to do this seems to be by squirting a zig-zag oil track across a sheet of paper as you shred it.The machine is touted to never jam.  That statement is a bit of stretch of the word.  Too much paper will make this machine just ""stop"", like all the others.  However, this machine will eventually power through on its own, or, you can give it a power assist by pushing on the ""hyper power"" ring surrounding the main power switch.  This does prevent the onerous task of removing a jammed stack of pages from the feed slot, but, the machine still stops if overfed.  (I guess I'm looking for something equivalent to a tree chipper that will take whatever it is fed and shred it!)The 89ci has a ""power on"" switch on the back and a switch on the top lower right front corner of the top which serve duplicate functions. One could be left off.  Also, there is a cascade of lights on the top right that indicate when the feed load will slow/stop the machine.  This is also overkill.  A single warining light would be more than enough.  Finally, the ""on"" switch incorporates a light that is totally unnecessary.  When you feed the machine and it is turned on, then, the machine should shred.  If it fails to work, then turn it on.  The elimination of the fancy light cascade and the ""on"" light would reduce the consumption of power when the machine is not working and eliminate and unnecessary switch that can potentially fail.The separate CD/credit card shredder slot feature is a disappointment.  It is very difficult to make the machine feed a single credit card size object.  It will not grab it and feed.  I have had the best luck just sandwiching such cards between sheets of paper and using the regular feed.All in all, I am satisfied with the sturdiness of the unit and the way in which it functions.  But, it could be simplified and improved by removing all the bells and whistles and concentrating on making from follow function, potentially making the machine more durable and economical.  I am hopng that I don't face a similar failure with this macine and the nylon gearing mechanism.  Use the production savings from the switch and the light cascade mentioned above to make the nylon gears out of steel and improve the durability of the machine by a quantum leap!",4,"More power, less bells and whistles",1231286400,"01 7, 2009",702,35,37,0.945945946,helpful

I've been using this for two things: scanning documents into PDF as part of effort to get organized, and scanning old negatives I have into photos.First, the PDFs: It's literally a no-brainer. Once you install the desktop software, there's a button that you press on the scanner and in under a minute, you have it in a PDF format. I haven't tried anything more advanced like editing PDFs, but generally that requires something like the full Adobe Acrobat suite at 5x the cost of the scanner.As for scanning images - the scanning is great and the enclosed mount that you can put negatives on is great, but the rough part is actually developing your own little workflow in order to scan images. I'm an amateur photographer, and workflows are everything. You'll need ample drive space if you want to start scanning your photos and figure out if you want to preserve them in lossless (TIFF) or lossy (JPG) and at what quality. For most people, JPG are fine, but if you're going through the effort to scan old photos, you might as well do it correctly.I'm rather happy with this scanner.

Mostly from such brick-and-mortar stores like Staples, Office Depot, or maybe Home Depot.Maybe I wasn't being very observant of the additional photos supplied on this item page.  The box construction will be DOUBLE WALLED on ALL four sides when assembled.  This is a big plus over the cheap-o ones that tend to 'sag' when stacked.  The additional feature I am very, VERY pleased with is that the box tops have a tab cut out to fit into the handle cut-outs.  This means, when you move/lift the box, you are actually lifting BOTH the handle and the CONNECTED lid.  No chance for the lid to fall off when carrying or stowed away.  Nice design element, more thoughtful for sure.  (You can see the handle cut-out still folded into the lid on the 2nd photo).  Granted, I just received these a couple hours ago, and have assembled only a few so far...The dye-cut seems very adequate on these.  The flaps for assembly seem to 'fit' very nicely, retaining their shape with good tension- if you know what I mean (sometimes the flaps don't reach to the bottoms, creating a 'flapping' looseness or something).  The tabs all fit together nicely (especially important on the lid edges IMHO).While I wish someone would make these boxes with no graphics, or something more subdued (at least), these blue ""exp"" graphics are less bothersome to my eyes than most.These very realistically will not require any tape for sturdy assembly.  Some of the other 'types' I have purchased previously, I used packaging tape to help make them more stable and/or remove 'seams' on the bottom panel where small items might shift to and get lost.Lastly, the packaging.  While, there is surely some irony to using a packing box to ship boxes, this came without banged-up or dog-eared corners from FedEx Ground.  No, they aren't using styrofoam corners you'd be more likely to see for a picture frame or something.  But they are all intact in my delivery.  I ordered these from dealgenius, free ground shipping.  Why?  Some sellers may cost less, but if there is ANY problem, I would be out shipping for a return or exchange- so I always try to find the best value using free shipping when possible.I ordered on Wed June 1st during lunchtime, a week ago.  The next day I had already a message saying they shipped (7am pacific time).  So, props to dealgenius/exp for quick attention too!  I think these are 'drop-shipped' from the manufacturer; ship label says Chicago, IL.  Thursday ship to Wednesday June 7th delivery in San Francisco.  Usually Chicago to me is four ship days tops, but there's still possibilities of inclement weather- and this is about FedEx Ground, not ""exp"" nor dealgenius, nor amazon.com.-------------------------------------------------If I had a need for more, I would DEFINITELY re-order these.  For a storage unit, for example.  The price of just over $2/box is fantastic, very sturdy double-walled after assembly, and the secured lid tabs fitting into the handles is the deal-clincher for me.Hope this is helpful to someone out there considering these.

831537,A1RLT88UZ9B7CD,B004I2HXRY,skatastic425,"[25, 27]","After reading all of the mostly positive Amazon reviews for the Bostitch QuietSharp Glow Electric Pencil Sharpener, I couldn't help but make the dive and purchase it. It seemed like the king of all pencil sharpeners - fast, quiet, and sleek. What else could I ask for? And I got it at a decent price through Amazon. As a first-year teacher, I was excited to make this purchase for my first classroom.Well, turns out I was completely wrong about this sharpener. When I plugged the unit in and sharpened my first pencil, some unexpected and extremely disappointing things happened. Skeptical? I would be, too, because this sharpener seems so awesome, and the positive reviews are abundant. Here's what I found...First, I noticed that the unit, contrary to its title, isn't really all that quiet. I've heard plenty of electric sharpeners in various classrooms, and this one isn't really much quieter than any other sharpener I've used or seen. It's sad because its selling point, in my opinion, is the quietness with which it's supposed to sharpen, but that's not what happens. I expected something much quieter for its being advertised as a quiet sharpener.Second, and also contrary to its title, the point on the pencil is not sharp after sharpening. I tried four pencils before I was too disgusted and had to stop, and each time I sharpened a pencil that thing happened where the wood comes up over the top of the lead; this is completely inexcusable for the price of this sharpener. A pencil sharpener is supposed to sharpen pencils the last time I checked, not make them dull. I was using top-quality pencils (Ticonderoga), so I can't even blame the brand or quality of pencils. And what makes things worse is that after the sharpener thinks it's sharpened your pencil fully, it shuts off automatically, and to sharpen it again you have to pull the pencil out, wait a couple of seconds, and put it back in, only for it to mess up yet again. It's a vicious and frustrating cycle. Sure, the blue illuminated ring looks pretty cool, but that's MAYBE this sharpener's only redeeming quality. I wish the sharpener wouldn't automatically shut off because sometimes you might want to fine-tune your point and leave it in a bit longer to make sure it's completely sharpened. With this sharpener, you have to remove the pencil and reinsert it. I could see this frustrating the students in my class, and it would only prolong the trips to the sharpener during class, thus frustrating ME in the end.Third, while sharpening, the unit shook up and down in a sort of bouncing motion. I expected for its size, weight, and the fact that it has suction pads on the bottom that it would stay at least fairly still while sharpening. The shaking is not a huge deal, but it's just another annoyance to add to the list.Fourth, it's hard to determine this from the pictures, bit this thing is HUGE. A pencil sharpener in a classroom should be somewhat compact, discreet, and out of the way, and you should be able to move it anywhere because the classroom could change at any point. I could see this device being in the way all the time and taking up way too much space. At first glance it looks like some kind of kitchen appliance.The bottom line: the Bostitch QuietSharp Glow Electric Pencil Sharpener is certainly a good idea and a cool concept (who wouldn't want a quiet, fast pencil sharpener in the classroom?), but its poor functionality and poorly executed design leave me no choice but to give it 1 of 5 stars. I can't even think of any redeeming qualities for this sharpener. It is not very quiet, it does not leave a sharp point, and it's way too big for most classrooms. If anything a pencil sharpener should leave nice, fine points on pencils and then I could tolerate other minor flaws, but this product does not even sharpen pencils adequately, especially for the high cost. For less than half the cost of this pencil sharpener you could find something much more convenient and efficient for your classroom.

So the perennial also-ran, Canon, has stepped in with this worthy successor to the S750.The i550 is no great breakthrough product. Inkjet printers have become settled commodity items. And they are becoming very cheap. So the question is whether quality has suffered. For the i550, the answer is no. The ink comes in individual tanks for economy and has been reformulated so as not to fade. Speed is comparable to older Canon models and is faster in every mode than most Epsons and HPs. It is interesting that draft mode shows little degradation from standard mode for text and graphics but is noticably faster still and will be the setting of choice for all internal documents. But neither will you be ashamed to send anyhting you print in standard mode out into the world.

I accepted a new telephone number that was provided by Ooma free of charge and installation and everything was without incident.  Overall process took about an hour.The other Ooma (Core) device was installed using AT&T; DSL with number porting.  This was a ""Nightmare and a half"" and I hope that I can gift some pointers to anyone reading this review as a step in the right direction.  If you want to keep your existing telephone number, you need to request a ""number port"" from Ooma.  This is a basic form that you fill out and complete, pay a $39 fee and wait a minimum of 6 weeks.  This is the time that it takes for Ooma to port your existing number from AT&T; as they had mentioned to me that the FCC is involved and this is why there is so much bureaucratic wait time.Unfortunately, there is no easy way to keep DSL and operate an Ooma device.  AT&T; recommends a ""dry loop"" service.  This means that your phone line will be disconnected and you will have an internet connection through a non-working phone jack.  DSL works by your existing telephone number attached to your internet connection.  Believe me, AT&T; will give you the ""run-around"" for days and days and tell you how impossible this is to do and by the end of all of this calamity...you'll just want to return this Ooma device back to Amazon and forget about ""free"" phone service forever.Persistence pays off and this is what you would have to do.  Step one...disconnect your internet DSL service, but request that your telephone number remain active.  Your phone number must remain active in order for Ooma to port this number and it must remain in active status for at least 6-8 weeks.  If for some reason you lose the number...there is about a week or so time frame to get your number back before it may be released to someone else.  You will also lose your internet service...I would recommend finding another internet service in the meantime and go back to AT&T; after your commitment is over.  I went with Comcast as they are having a sale.  Step two...wait for your number to port over and you're done.If you don't care about losing your telephone number with this changeover, then you should have lesser problems.  Just request for a ""dry loop"" change.I received an email from Ooma in regards to their changes in terms and conditions.  What was suppose to be ""free"" forever has some ""hick-ups"".  Phone calls up to 5,000 minutes are ""free"".  Anything after that, you will be charged.  That's over 80 hours of calling per month and well over what I will ever use, but if you see yourself needing more...this plan is not for you.  Ooma Premier has decreased to $9.99.  411 calls are now $0.99.  Ooma encourages you to use ""800-GOOG-411"" or ""800-FREE-411"" as these are both free calls.Ooma customers who bought through a ""club store"" or the Telo: You get 5,000 minutes per month.  Premiere subscription rate is also $9.99/month.  If you pay the yearly $119.99 fee, your number port or Telo handset is free.  After your first full year of service...a $11.75 per year regulatory fee will be charged to you.  You get 60 days of free support and after that it will be $39.99 per year.Overall, this is still an awesome product.  I think that with Amazon and the ""club stores"" pushing this business as much as they have...Ooma became bigger than they knew possible.  I think that the FCC may have imposed stricter guidelines on them and this may be where the extra charges are stemming from.  Ooma to Ooma calls are quite clear.  I had a complaint from the AT&T; representative on the other end that she was having a hard time hearing me...but that was only after I had revealed to her that I was calling using Ooma already.I recommend Ooma.  If you have DSL...disconnect your internet and find an internet service free of a phone line.  If the power goes out in your household...you're not going to have a telephone as your internet will be down.

I am using it on a 64bit Windows 7 desktop computer.Pros:- Wireless connection- Nice looking unit- Paper contained within the printer with decent capacity- Separate color cartridges to reduce waste- Nice looking printing- Two-sided at a decent speed (although much slower than one-sided)- Nice scan quality (scanning via USB)Cons:- Substantial software install on each machine using this printer- Several processes going on in the background to monitor functions even if you don't use the printer much- I was unable to get the scanning to work wirelessly, although printing worked fine- fairly loud while printing.Not pro or con but clarification:- The ""2.5"" LCD with touch panel"" isn't a touch screen; the touch panel doen't belong to the LCD screen but to the printer. The screen is just a screen and the ""touch panel"" are ""touch"" buttons and not push buttons, as you might find on any multifunction printer.- It claims 40% lower printing costs vs color laser, which might very well be true, but the 40% is very large on the box and it should be clear that printing isn't all that cheep and likly on a par with other inkjets, which are typically quite expensive. There are four individual cartridges, one black and three color, and it is cheaper to buy the color cartridges as a set. It takes either 126 (T126120 Ultra 126 High-capacity -Black for about $18andT126520 Ultra 126 High-capacity Inkjet Cartridge Color Multipack for about $42) or 127 (T127120 Ultra 127 Extra High-capacity Inkjet Cartridge-Black for about $23andEpson DURABrite T127520 Ultra 127 Extra High-capacity Inkjet Cartridge Color Multipack for about $46). Although they aren't much more expensive, the 127s give you much higher capacity. Epson claims black goes from 385 to 945 standard pages while color goes from 470 to 755 pages going from the 126 model to the 127 model cartridges. They are physically the same, just one chamber remains unfilled on the 126. So to replace all the cartridges is between $60 and $72, which is about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of the printer.I set up Wifi by selecting the WiFi wizard. It identified my network and password, it connected, and that was that.  There was a hiccup on connecting as it isn't simply plug and play.  It recognized the printer but it could not find the drivers (the instructions tell you that this is to be expected). I had to install the software on the enclosed CD, which I don't like to do as I don't want more things running in the background.  The CD install took about 10-15 minutes and would be a pain to do on more than just a few computers. I will look for the drivers directly and see if I can bypass the install on our other computers.It also took another 30 minutes or so to download and attempt to install new firmware for the printer (which was initiated by the install disk), which I imagine just has to be done once. The firmware update did not complete after 30 minutes and I had to end the process (ctrl+alt+delete) and unplug the printer. In the end I have two services now running (""Epson Customer Participation"" and ""Epson Scanner Service"") and three startup applications (""EEventManager Applicaton"", and ""Epson PC-Fax Software"" (twice)) in the background.Although the printing is very good, the setup has been frustrating and I can't recommend this printer.",3,"It doesn't work on my network, nice scanning, claims about touch and cost",1350864000,"10 22, 2012",591,42,46,0.913043478,helpful

Unfortunately it is a bugger to photograph well, but here are some I took this evening.Onto surfaces the moving beams fall in roving dots of light, scattering all about. Gaze at them, play with them or simply let them skate around your room making the depths deeper and the close closer.The first time I turned this on I felt a bit stupid. This was not the soothing galaxy I had been promised, it was just some green dots, but ooh, was that a shooting star? Oh they move, but some are slow and oh gosh there are tiny ones and is that one sparkling?

It's dreamy and fun way to recall the nature of light.On the downside...I gather it is not safe to leave on for more than a few hours, so you could not use it as a nightlight unless you had a timer and that still poses a risk. It is all too easy to look into the laser beam by mistake. It's all too easy to forget basic safety stuff if you are somewhat mesmerised.I'd imagine that the lasers are green because the wavelength is the most suitable for the project, but it isn't the most attractive colour.

Because it has not been bounced around the moving mirrors inside the device it is falls in the centre, it is static and it is the biggest star.

We wanted a laser printer as an ink toner cartridge that lasts 500 pages won't go far with 30-40 page documents.  That said we spent quite a bit of time looking around and we found the Brother HL-2280 Printer was a small and inexpensive device which takes a Brother TN-450 toner cartridge that provides a decent cost per page.  My girlfriend went to Staples to play with and purchase the said printer and the cashier, the clerk informed her that the starter toner in the printer would only print 20 (twenty) pages before running out, and therefore she should purchase a new toner to go with it; he offered to sell her a TN-420.  Really?  Lying Thieves, thankfully she wasn't suckered in by this gimmick.  For reference, the printer comes with a TN-420 toner cartridge which according to staples.com prints 1,200 pages.  I can only assume that the pimply geek with huge gauge holes in his ears was flat out lying in order to get her to purchase a toner cartridge and improve his sales attach rate.  Also, the two year warranty is only 29.99.  Thanks, we'll pass. I hope it dies before two years is up so it can fill a dumpster somewhere.Step 1) Plug in, configure wifi (Fail #1)With the printer at home I plug it in, and turn it on.  Open the menu, go to wifi and use the wifi protected setup menu, which i've admittedly never used.  I choose the option where it gives me a code that i type in to the router, and then the devices pair.  60 seconds later my belkin router says device connected successfully, and the printer spits out a page saying failed.  I tried a couple variations of this and eventually gave up.  Ultimately I connected to the printer via an ethernet cable, connected to the web interface with the default username of admin and the default password of password and managed to configure the wireless from there.Step 2) Connect to computer (Fail #2)I used the add a printer wizard in Windows 7 and to my delight it was quickly detected.  Except the printer driver wasn't found.  I went to the brother website and download the printer driver, installed it via computer management and I'm off to the races!Step 3) Print a document (The only successful step)It prints. Oh, and it can print on both sides / duplex perfectly.Step 4) Scan a document (Fail #3)I press the scan button expecting the scan to email function similar to other brother AIO's I've used.  It says check connection.  This device can only perform the scanning functions through the brother software.  No problem I say! I download the 130MB software, install it (reboot required... ugh it's 2011), and scan a document.  All of the defaults scan to JPG, including scan to email or file.  I change it to default to PDF and go to scan my document.  As it turns out, this brother All In One HL-2280DW IS NOT CAPABLE of scanning multiple pages in to a single document.  Say you want to scan and email a 2 page document, you will need to scan it in to two separate files and email them separately.  The scanner we had some 12 or 15 years ago was capable of this simple functionality.  Press scan, it scans the document, asks you if there are any more pages, and either scans the next page or finishes with the file.Step 5) Return for full refund.Reason stated on return claim: defective.My Backstory:I have installed and used multiple brother all in one laser devices (which don't have the majority of these issues) and figured I'd give them a shot since at the budget end their cost per page is far lower than the competing HP model (1.7c/page vs 5c/page).  I have no previous hatred of brother until this new device was purchased (and about to become returned).UPDATE:It turns out it is possible to scan multiple pages.  The preferences menu doesn't show the option, but if you right click on the email or file button for example, and go to settings you get almost the exact same menu you find under preferences, but it has a checkbox for manual scan.  It does work.  The downside is you must return to your computer to press the next page button, and the software on the computer effectively does a new scan job and stitches the two together.  This is clearly a piece of equipment meant for scanning one page things, and the software isn't well designed (why does the checkbox only show up on right click -> settings, instead of the main preferences tab you get?",2,Huge disappointment,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",837,28,39,0.717948718,helpful

710856,ADKZ4EYI4K272,B003JQLHEA,Keith McLaren Photography,"[315, 322]","I purchased the CanoScan 9000f recently and wanted to review the scanner as I begin to work through the process of learning this unit.  To set the stage, I am a photographer and I have never gone back and scanned my old film photographs.  I have about 30 years of film and the task is a large one.  I finally decided that I needed to buy something since I have my wedding photo proofs and they are now 15 Years old and I know that they will not last forever.My objectives in this project gave me a few requirements for a scanner.  Here is what I was looking for...1. Since this project is about scanning my wedding photos, I wish to remain married.  This means that I cannot buy multiple scanners, spend $1000's on a scanner or fill my office with large quantities of gear.2. I wanted a device that would make high-ish resolution scans of both film and prints.  I need to scan my wedding proofs since I have no negatives.  I also need to scan a large quantity of 35mm and a few medium format film frames.3. I want a solution that allows me to scan multiple 35mm frames without manual interaction.  I have used other scanners in the past and I know that each scan takes a while.  Thus I also know that if you can scan multiple frames at once then you can walk away and load the thing up again later.  This helps to speed up the arduous process of scanning film.After reading MANY reviews I saw the good and bad of the 9000F and decided to give it a try.  The biggest complaint was that the quality is substandard to high end film-only scanners.  I decided that since a $1,000+ device is not in my current budget that if under $200 this unit was worth the risk.When I received the unit it installed in less then 10 minutes without any problems.  It's sure not a bulletproof design, but it seems to be made reasonably well for a machine at this price point.  It has all sorts of nice easy to use features to scan various kinds of doc's with a press of a button and they seem to work as advertised, but for my needs I don't really use these.  I quickly dug into the advanced mode in the scan driver since I am looking to use this thing to its limits.What is really nice here is that Canon gives you a suite of tools that allow you to use the driver without calling the driver from a TWAIN compliant program.  This is nice for bulk scans since there is no need to have the overhead of having a program like photoshop open just to call the TWAIN scanning program.  You have a button dashboard that lets you choose and action and in my case I hit ""Scan"".  This opens another utility that allows you to select your scan options.  One of these options is to set your setting in the TWAIN driver itself and this is going to be the choice that you want to use if you are doing more critical work.  When you hit scan it opens the TWAIN driver where you can choose the ""Advanced"" tab to get down to the nitty gritty.This is where I find some cool features and some frustrating limitations.  What is really nice is that when you scan film it automatically crops each frame and you don't really need to deal with multiple frames or cropping.  So far, the cropping has been spot on for my film.  However, there are some serious limitations.  The first one is that the Canon utilities limit your scans to 10,000 pixels and about 100Mb is size.  The size limit is not the output size limit but the incoming data size. (H x W x Color Depth)  Thus your 100Mb files actually end up at about 5-7 Mb JPG files at output.  (unless you choose to use TIFF Files)Another big limitation is that the driver does not give you effective control over sizing your images.  In todays world we care about images in a digital world.  We care about resolution in Pixels not paper size.  The resolution is most important since we generally allow our printing software to scale images to fit the output device's resolution and paper size. Where the Canon scan driver is lacking is that it does not give you any control over the input from the device but rather has you setup the output settings in terms of DPI and Paper Size.  The best solution that I have found is to set a custom paper size and set it to Pixels in place of inches and then set the size to 6666 x 10,000 which gets you to the 10,000 limit but gives the right aspect for a 35mm frame.  The downside to this method is that once you do this the driver is no longer able to pass along the direction of the images and you must rotate them manually after they are scanned.  (with the automatic settings, the driver can actually rotate your images which is a nice feature)The second limitation that I see is that after you scan in the driver, the photo's are in some sort of a cache.  You need to exit the driver in order to have the utility copy them to your selected location.  This slows down the process since the copy locks up the software for about a minute as the copy happens.  You then must Press two ""scan"" buttons again to get back into the advanced scan dialog.  This is a small complaint, but it's unnecessary.Now for some positives.  I am VERY happy with the scanning output of this device.  I cannot tell you what the scanner resolution is when I scan since the only resolution setting you can change is output resolution.  (in other words, I can set the output to 9600 DPI / 1"" x 1.3"" and get the exact same output as if I use 4800 DPI / 2"" x 2.6"".  Both images would be 9600 x 12,480 with the difference being in the EXIF data)  What I can say is that I am getting crisp images with an output resolution of 10,000 x 6666.  The images are a bit soft since I do not use the ""unsharp mask"" feature.  I have been doing my sharpening in lightroom and the NIK software tools and I prefer the results.  However, if you are not a professional photographer and don't understand the intricacies of sharpening manually, the unsharp mask seems to provide a reasonable result for basic photos and prints.  Another feature that works well is the ""FARE"" dust and scratch removal.  This is the only automated feature that I am using, but it works well and provides results that I could not achieve in post processing.  (due to its ability to look at the film with infrared technology)Now, back to the output files.  The resulting files are reasonably good considering the source material.  The film I have scanned to date is all from the mid/late 90's and the colors are crisp.  They output is a bit overly contrast-y on some of the images, but it's are to tell yet if this is a function of the scanner or the photo's.  Prints can EASILY be blown up to 8x10 and likely 16x20 with a little bit of work in post processing. Photo's generally need some sharpening and noise reduction and also require a bit of adjustment in terms of contrast and curves to bring them down from that heavy contrast look.Here are some quick comments for those who are skimming the article:SCAN SPEED: 35mm Film @ 10,000 x 6,666 pixels x 24 bit color --- ~8 minutes per frameMAX USABLE RESOLUTION: 10,000 x 6,666 with just Canon utilities when scanning 35mm FilmINCLUDED SOFTWARE: Good, but has some limitations.SETUP TIME (HARDWARE): 15 MinutesSETUP TIME (SOFTWARE): 10 Minutes to Install.  5 Minutes to get first snapshot quality scan.4 hours before I got a scan to look the way I wanted at 10,000 x 6,666.I will continue to update this review as I work with this scanner more.",4,Good scanner with a few limitations,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",1369,315,322,0.97826087,helpful

I don't need to keep an extra key just to open a box to get to the other keys! I spent an entire weekend looking for a keyless entry key safe for a reasonable price and this was the only one I found.  There were others similar, but more expensive and I believe they used the same safe and named it something different to sell on their own sites.  The least expensive I found for this model was here on Amazon (in March 2007).  Save yourself the trouble, just get this if you're looking for a keyless pushbutton key box.This is a great key box for many reasons:1. No key is needed, just punch in a code on the push button combination on the front.2. It holds 30 keys (although that many is a little crowded) and has #d key rings to attach to the keys.3. It holds about 10 keys on the inside of the door itself.4. It is a sturdy metal box, not a thin metal one like at retail places like office max / depot, etc. and comes with mounting hardware.5. I use it at my workplace where only a few people can have access to certain keys.  Those keys go in this box and I didn't have to worry about handing out keys.  If someone leaves, I can change the combo easily.6. The combo was easy to set and is easy to change, just a couple of minutes.I noticed some reviews mentioning home use and I agree that if someone really wanted to, they could break into this, after all, they could just pull it off they wall and do what they needed to it.  But I think most of us realize a $60 lock box isn't the last line of defense, or should be.  It's best used in a trusted area to keep people from having the opportunity to take the keys that aren't locked up in the first place.",5,Great for Workplaces.,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",342,18,18,1,helpful
198901,A3JYERUBPUDLRS,B000CO8786,B. Ruffley,"[11, 11]","This printer is a great choice for a few reasons. The least reason to buy a printer is appearance, sure, but the stylish blue appearance on the HP 6980 makes it one of the best looking printers out there. Wireless setup is by far the best reason to chose this printer. I was a bit hesitant about how easy it would work, but the documentation in the box by HP (paper manuals) was very helpful. Just take the printer and the router, run an Ethernet cord between them, and run the software on your PC (PC doesn't need to be connected to it). Then it instructs you to remove the ethernet cable and in the end, only the power plug needs to be present. I have one Vista desktop and one Vista laptop currently set to this printer.Some issues to note. It does in fact shake, as I guess many printers probably shake. I recommend placing this on a different desk/table from which you use for your desktop and/or laptop. It's only a minor inconvenience though. Even with my desktop on the same table, I still feel the shaking somewhat noticeably.The CD in the package is essentially useless for Vista users. Now in the store, you might see it say ""compatible with Vista"" and it is, though not as simple as some people I'm sure have been misled to believe. You will need to download the software from the HP site. It's not hard, just a few clicks on the HP site will get you there. Download and then install on EACH PC with which you'd like the printer to work.One other quick note. The printer allows you to print a report page showing the printer's status on your network and other relevant details as well as an IP address you can enter in the browser that shows details such as ink levels and allows some configuration. HP seems to know printers quite well. Highly recommended!",5,Great Wireless Choice,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",326,11,11,1,helpful

They don't bleed through porous paper (like newsprint).  They write on slick and glossy surfaces (even Scotch heavy duty postal packaging tape!).  They don't smear (not even when used on that slick tape).  And they don't dry out when left uncapped (the writing point is all gel).  However, I don't like them, because I find it hard to control both where the highlighting color goes on the page, and how much color goes on the page.  Also, the colors themselves are rather pale, even though they are fluorescent.The writing ""point"" on the highlighters is a broad, half-inch-wide, rounded-off stub that more or less ""conforms to your handwriting style"", as advertised.  You advance the point as it wears down by twisting the opposite end (it works like a glue stick).  Although the points are wide, the color generally goes on as thin or medium underlining, and with practice it is possible to place the underlining consistently between the lines of text.  However, it is fairly hard to highlight over the text so that entire sentences will stand out as fully highlighted, rather than as merely underlined.For me, using these highlighters takes too much concentration.  I end up thinking more about the color placement than about what it is that I'm trying to read and understand.  That's why, for now, I will be sticking with traditional felt-tipped, chisel-point highlighters (e.g.,Avery HI-LITER Desk Style Highlighters 4 Pack (24063)orSharpie Accent Tank-Style Highlighters, 12 Yellow Highlighters(25005)), which are easier to control and allow me to go over important passages a second time to darken the color and make the whole sentences really stand out.

It works because the stick offers a ""path"" that you can follow with your eyes, and find the place being pointed at. By contrast, a laser pointer is very distracting.

I did not understand that it wasn't going to be just a 2nd handset - you can use the new one OR the old version, but not both at the same time.It is SO much better.  Calls are very crystal clear, and there hasn't been any dropping of anything, no echoes, nothing at all to complain about.The new handset is different in that the screen stays on all the time, showing the time, and info.  The old one would go dark, but this one stays its colorful self.******  Original:I carefully kept my landline for 4 months after I got it, while I tried it out.  As I was paying over $40 a month for my $24 ""basic service"", I resented paying that much for a phone I did not use much - especially that much in taxes & fees, and it seemed like those increased every year!Ooma is not perfect.  It behaves a lot like a cell phone: Most of the time, it is a perfectly clear call.  Once in a while, people on the other end complain about an echo.  Sometimes the call gets dropped.After almost 3 years, I am very happy with it, about 90% of the time. That is a better average then I would give my cell phone (which is an old basic phone on a pay per call plan).I DO appreciate paying less than $4 a month for taxes, which are the fees that Ooma is now forced to pay the government.  That is why, even though the service is free, they had to start charging people.  It is the government enforcing some basic give-us-money taxes, not Ooma.I do pay about $10 a month to get all the bells and whistles.  I really like that Ooma screens out almost all the telemarketers - I have only gotten 3 political calls, versus the huge number my friends get.  I really like being able to blacklist anyone I want to, so when a local call came through, from the local Republican party, I could just add them to my own personal ""do not call"" list.It IDs all the numbers it can, and it also IDs from your own address book of phone numbers.Would I do it again - absolutely.I recently somehow turned on the answering machine on my old phone, which I also have hooked up to ooma.

I am always coming up with an excuse to get a newer version.  I still have a MP F80 purchased YEARS ago and it still works. Next I bought a MP780; my daughter is still using it.  Then I bought a MP830; just took it to the office to use so I would have an excuse to buy the new MX870.  I was thrilled with how easy it was to set up on my wireless network, flawless connectivity, fast printing, ease of use.  HOWEVER, I have one HUGE problem.  The print output colors are not the same as the originals.  I have a new Toshiba laptop using Windows 7 Pro.  I have tried printing from MS Word 2003, photocopying a graphic document, and printing a colored web page.  In all instances the print copy is different from the original.  The reds are an orange red, the cyan a medium blue, the green darker, the yellow is a different shade.  It's as if there's something ""dark"" mixing in the colors, especially the blues.  I contacted Canon technical support and they were great.  The guy, who speaks perfect English and was in Virginia, stayed on the phone with me for two hours troubleshooting.  Finally I had to leave so he had me send a copy of the document I was trying to print to a senior technical support guy.  That was Thursday - I haven't heard back from them yet.  I have never had any problems with ANY of my former Canon products.  The copies always matched the originals perfectly.  So now I am stumped.  I think it's going to take a new printhead or a total replacement to fix but I'll have to find out next week.  I will post an update when I find out.

They mailed me out a new printhead to see if it would fix the problem.  It did not.  I was offered the choice of taking it to a repair center free of charge or a replacement (refurbished).

Putting it together is a breeze - just 4 screws to attach to the base. The chair bed is wrapped in a zippered fabric that is breathable and appears to be durable. Also, the color is not bright red but rather a more pleasant pleasing red as there are very light black lines woven into the weave that tempers the red color. One would assume that one could remove the zippered cover and wash it, if needed, but trying to re-zipper the product, I suspect, wouldn't be that easy. The chair opens to a regular size twin bed, so it has plenty of space for one to sleep comfortably. One can convert the chair to a bed very easily (note that the additional two legs to support the product in a flat bed position are hidden under the zipper). The mattress is about 4"" thick and has a ""firm"" feel to it. I assume that adding more thickness would make the product bulky especially when in a chair position, however if the designer of this chair-bed added another inch to the mattress, preferably of memory foam, they could have easily converted a good product into a killer product. I expected the metal base to be substantial but it is light and simple. The pillow, which is also draped in the same fabric (and comes with its own zipper so you can easily wash the cover) is also quite nice, and is a nice touch.

Also I have a beautiful glass top desk and my printer sits in a cabinet behind me so every time I wanted to print I had to move my computer to the cabinet, plug in the cable and print. Not that big of a deal, but with the wireless printer, its so much easier!We researched a lot of printers and my husband decided this was the best one to get taking in account of replacement cartridges and all of the functions the printer has.The big down side of this printer is its level of complexity. In order to print an envelope I have to call Canon and get help. There was a lot to do just to print an envelope!However... Canon's tech support is very helpful and so I can recommend this printer knowing you can call tech support for help. There are 2 trays for feeding paper into the machine, so they helped me set the 2nd tray to envelopes default mode, and then if I want to print a brochure, they can help me go back and reset it to print a brochure or something. That is what I am saying, as long as you are willing to call Canon for support, this is a great printer.The print quality is excellent and this printer really is a rock star in terms of features, you just have to know how to set it, such as you have to set it for the type of paper you're using (paper weight & quality). But again... if you're willing to call for help, like I am, its a great printer.

I have used the Epson printers (2200, 1280) in the past to make my prints. While these printers do make excellent prints, the frustration I have always experienced has been in the color management end of printing. I've spent upwards of $80 a piece for professionally created icc profiles and even bought the ImagePrint RIP program in my attempts to obtain the perfect prints. While these solutions did work out to my satisfaction, they were an extra cost over and above the cost of the printer price. I always felt that if I was going to pay $600+ for a printer, that it should produce a great print right out of the box.The 8750 does just that! This is because the color-management is done for you in the driver when using the HP papers. This printer works as well as my Epson 2200 did without the fuss. The HP 8750 gives me perfectly neutral B&W;'s with great detail in the shadows and no blow-out in the highs. It's a printer that does it's job right without the user needing to learn any of the 'secret techniques'.You may read that HP forces you to use their papers to get the best quality, but after some Internet research I learned that the surface of HP's semi glossy is similar to Ilford's Galerie Smooth Gloss paper. Galerie Smooth Gloss had been my paper of choice with the 2200 and I had quite a large stock of it in different sizes. Still being able to use the Ilford was one of the major reason I decided to go with the HP over the Epson 2400 upgrade. You will need to use Ilford's icc profile to get good results. But the HP procedure is far less complicated than Epson's and it's well documented in their manual.In my attempts in the past to create the neutral b&w; print, I had used the MIS inking system and turned the Epson 1280 into a dedicated black and white printer. But within a year the nozzles became clogged from the ink. Plus that ink was EXPENSIVE! $45-50/CART! So I ended up buying the ImagePrint software for the 2200. Another $500 spent! All in the quest for the holy grail of the perfect print. Ugh! Then there was the issue of metamerism with the Epson inks. Metamerism is where the prints looked different under different lighting conditions. With the HP, there is absolutely no metamerism!  I made one B&W; print on the 8750 that look great under the tungsten light of my room. I then ran downstairs to see it in the sunlight and it still looked great. This picture is now hanging in my office at work and under fluorescent light, it still looks great. That's impressive!One more great thing about printer: the nozzles are built into the actual ink cartridges. So if I need to exchange, say, a dark gray for a black cartridge, I don't have to waste ink by going through a cleaning cycle because I'm installing a new nozzle atthe same time.

No matter how much I calibrated the printer, I still go blue streaks everywhere for normal printing. Very frustrating.'The PIXMA MP280  has satisfied that need. It comes with a bunch of bells and whistles, but I was looking for something I would use every day to print, scan and copy, something to replace my Epson printer and Epson scanner (two separate components). This fit that need very well.The price would lead you to believe that its quality is not very good. However, unless you're a photographer or graphic artist who requires really high resolution output onto really good paper, this is a fine addition to the office.With that said, here are some notes:First, you need to supply your own USB printer cable for this device. The printer does not come with one. Personally, I find this to be a huge miss. No manufacturer should assume that any customer has all the tools for the job. It's the same cable I use for my Epson, so I'm fine. This is such an easy way to make it easier on the end user. Therefore, this is a big miss.SETUP AND INSTALLATION: I'm on a Mac, so setup was complete and I was printing in under 30 minutes. The manual says you need at least 20 minutes for software installation, but mine was installed in less than 10.OUTPUT: Color printing was satisfactory. Nothing that I could hang on a wall (but I don't need it.) At standard printing, the color output was insanely slow - less than two pages per minute. If you use color printing at the ""fast"" selection, not much quality is sacrificed, and the printing came out to about four pages per minute. For black and white, the printing was again satisfactory, with about six pages per minute. As a note: In relation to the IPM, the problem with that measurement is that while we all print images, 99% of the time they are still on regular 8.5x11 paper. So the image could be nice, but the paper still has to come out. What I printed above were pdfs, and the color was SLOW.COPYING: Very easy. One button for color or black and white with satisfactory output. The copier warming up takes longer than the copy itself - a total of about 30 seconds.SCANNING: Again, satisfactory. The DPI is not very high, but this is an everyday scanner. Most of the customers would be people who want to share images on Facebook.COLOR CARTRIDGES: One of the things I hated about my old Epson was that I had to change out color cartridges about once every two months. I have run several dozen color prints through this and it's now telling me that I need a color refill. Ugh. So I'm not thrilled that I may face the same situation with this one.Overall, three stars. This is a solid printer for everyday use, and I like the compact size with the all-in-one features. The lack of a USB printer cable and the fact that it doesn't do a very good job with color ink consumption keep me from giving this really high marks. But this has a place in a home where it will see a lot of output, perhaps in a home with school-age children or home office.A good all-in-one, worth the money.",3,An All-In-One Great for Everyday Use,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",574,130,131,0.992366412,helpful

My teachers, parents and even my classmates and friends would comment and lecture me on how very difficult if not impossible it was to comprehend my scribble. To make matters worse, I write left handed and often I would smear my words with my left pinky making my bad writing even worse. It was the story of my life and I simply accepted my fate of illegible handwriting and even printing.Then a miracle happened. For my birthday, a great friend of mine sent me this Parker Sonnet fountain pen with a fine nib. Hah!!! I can't even use a pencil legibly and now a fountain pen? Well it worked! For some reason, my handwriting improved using this pen! Maybe it is because I do not have to exert much pressure on the nib as I have to with a ballpoint or pencil. Maybe it is because the nib ""grabs"" the paper. Maybe it forces me to slow down. I am not sure but I know that my handwriting has improved. Now, Thomas Edison's reputation (ever see his beautiful handwriting?) has nothing to fear but at least my handwriting isn't an illegible embarrassment anymore.Also, Parker pens come with their brand of ink called Quink. It dries into the paper so fast, that my pinky does not smear the ink like a ballpoint or pencil. Amazing!!! Now my pinky does not appear to have the beginnings of gangrene.This pen is also a good looking, classy instrument.

As a person who often uses the printer to print documents, occasional CV's, plus recreational printing of internet material, the laser printer had served me quite well.  But after seeing the print quality of this 990CSe, the switch was rather easy.The color images are outstanding.  Colors are excellent and crisp. It's output is sufficiently quick for an ink-jet, even for a person long used to blazing laser output speed.  No disappointment for the color images.The black and white print quality and speed of documents are mixed in rating.  First, the advertised 17 ppm speed is clearly impossible to achieve for all practical purposes.  While printing CV's on high quality paper on the highest resolution, the printer was able to print out only 3 pages in 1 minute or so.  To be fair, the speed can be improved by degrading the image quality but for any work related documents, that sort of image output would be unacceptable.The alphabet characters printed on high quality laser/copier paper, even on the best setting was, was like with any other ink-jets rather poor.  &quot;Bleed micro-lines&quot; are easily visible.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, when the same document was printed on premium quality 25% cotton fiber paper that one may use to print CV's on.

Apparently, Brother has worked out a way to make it use magenta and cyan along with the black, even if you're not using the color feature.That's the big caveat of this machine.

The set-up info is all on one page and is easy to understand. You get a disc which gets you through the set-up process with the wireless.The unit itself is the nicest piece of computer/printer/tv/dvd-type electronics I own. It looks like a Porsche Targa Carrera compared to my ratty old Dell laptop. Finally somebody has designed a printer that doesn't have a whole lot of dust-collecting nooks and crannies on top of the unit. The printer is almost completely smooth on top, black, with sexy cobalt blue lighting.I've printed about 15 pages of pictures so far and they look absolutely great. Some of the photo files are huge but the printing only takes about 30 seconds, 20 of those to upload the image. And this printer is smart, too--I closed the output tray to have a look at the paper supply tray and forgot to put the tray back down. When I printed the next photo (which you do by placing photographic paper in a different feeder) the Canon printer kindly remembered to open the output tray, which quietly hummed into the open position.I have only printed photos directly from my computer as that is the most convenient for me. I know there are several ways to load the photos directly into the printer, for example there is a tray which allows you to load directly from a DVD. I also stuck my photo card directly into the printer (SD MS is the name of the slot) and was able to scroll through the photos and view them on a screen which also gave the option to print.The flatbed scanner works great and just as quickly as my much more expensive Brother laser printer. You can print using the Canon software, but I prefer using the Microsoft picture viewer as I am already familiar with it. The canon menu also offers options for creating things like calendars, movies, et cetera.I will be interested to see how long the ink lasts, as the cartridges seem quite small (but I've been using laser printers for years so haven't seen the average size of an ink cartridge these days). The printer is ""Ink Tank Compatible"" which I had to look up online to figure out. I can't tell if they are refillable (by me) and can't readily find this information.I realize that I am a bit of a technological Neanderthal, so more computer-savvy people will probably have experienced some of the features I have mentioned and perhaps not be so impressed.

I loved the mesh seat and back that molded to my body and let the stray breezes pass through. I loved the adjustable arms -- make that arm. For one day, as I leaned thoughtfully on one of the arms, it went slamming to the floor. The beautiful carbon-color metal had snapped in two like an ice cube on a griddle. The cost of replacing it started at $170, plus labor. A few sheetmetal screws are now holding it in place. The other arm is intact, but refuses to stay where I put it.  I have a now automatic way of pulling it up and tightening it as hard as I can, which usually gives me about 20 minutes of comfort before I have to adjust. To Herman's credit, nothing else is broken. But I'm waiting, and, meanwhile, eyeing those $79 padded leather chairs at OfficeMax, just in case.UPDATE: Well, I was waiting for something else to happen, and sure enough, it did. The pneumatic device under the seat stopped working. I can raise the seat to full height, and it stays there for about one minute -- just long enough to lull me into a false sense of security. Then, WHAM! The seat drops all the way to the bottom. It's a lot like hitting a air pocket in a plane. No adjustments I made fixed it.

I believe we received two red ones, two yellow ones, and a white one. I wish the ""point"" on these were a little shorter; it extends past the ""nose"" of the handle by a slight amount, which makes it harder aim into the space at the end of an envelope than another (promotional item) letter opener we have in the office. The other letter opener also has a thicker body, which is easier to grip over a long period of opening a deluge of mail.The blade on the World's Most Efficient Letter Opener is VERY, *VERY* sharp. This is a good thing, because it means it slices through paper like nothing at all -- very smooth motion, no drag whatsoever. I am convinced that the angle and depth of the blade contribute to this; the blade is a lot larger comparatively than in other similar products. However, one downside of this is that the very end of the blade protrudes past the guard ""bump"" on the handle, which means that it is possible to get a fingertip caught in it, if not very likely for a reasonably-careful adult operator.Overall, especially for the price, our office has been extremely pleased with these letter openers; they are definitely the best option on the market right now without delving into the promotional products business with its hundred-piece minimum orders.

I loved that machine, but when its fuser assembly finally went, the technician told me it just wasn't worth fixing.So I went comparison shopping for a replacement.  It made sense to start with Xerox, but I wasn't crazy about their comparable model (PE-16).  So I looked at their M15i model, which was a bit more expensive than I'd planned to go ($1,100).  Reviews on the model were scarce, but I went ahead and purchased it.  When it came, I was horribly disappointed.  It interfered with my home wireless network--the network would no longer work once the driver was loaded. Finally, the programming on this unit was all screwed up--even though I'd chosen ""English,"" the printer dialogue box was mostly in German. In addition, a menu item that was supposed to reduce background copy marks was not even present, so all my copies had a gray-dotted background. I called tech support, who tried to talk me through the settings to turn on the needed feature to reduce the background ""noise,"" but the programming menu was missing a vital selection. The technician finally told me that there must be a ""glitch.""So, not surprisingly, the machine went back. Which left me back at square one.Then I started reading reviews on the Brother 8840-D.  I briefly considered buying a Canon ImageClass, but it was lacking too many features that the Brother offered. So, I took the plunge and purchased the Brother 8840-D at Office Depot for $500, plus an added $90 for a two-year warranty on top of the one-year warranty that comes with the machine.  I have been thrilled with it.  It produces clear copies, faxes, and scans.  Its double-sided features take a bit of practice to figure out (there are a ton of configurations), but once you do, you'll love how easily you can print 2-sided copies from either 1- or 2-sided copies. (I had a brief moment of panic, when I noticed that the machine only printed 2-sided from 2-sided copies with the back side upside down.  My panic quickly turned to relief, however, when I realized that I merely had to turn the 2-sided copy 180 degrees when I sent the original through again to copy the even-numbered pages! I was a bit slow...)The machine integrated into my existing wireless network (between my laptop and desktop) seamlessly (unlike the Xerox M15i), and I was able to hit the ground running immediately.  There's an option to purchase an additional 250-page paper tray on top of the 250-page tray that comes standard. I may actually do this--I make a ton of copies so the current tray does empty quickly. It's hard to find a copier with a 500-page tray that comes standard OR optional, so I'm very glad Brother has this as an additional option.Perhaps the only con to this machine is the complexity of its features. A few times I was about to get angry at the machine because I couldn't make it do what I wanted--BUT calming down and referring to the manual enabled me to set it up the way I wanted every time.  I've had one problem with trying to make it print several copies from a 50-page, single-sided original--it says it runs out of memory.  But it DOES print several copies from a double-sided original. So far, I've just done it that way instead.Unlike many machines I have purchased, this machine has NOT REQUIRED A SINGLE CALL TO TECH SUPPORT.  That's huge.  If I do call, it will probably be to sort out that memory problem mentioned above.I would recommend the Brother 8840-D for any small home-based business.  It does it all: single- and double-sided copies, scan-once-print-many, faxing, scanning. It also has a 50-page document feeder--most other comparable copiers, such as from Canon, only go up to 30-page.  My initial toner cartridge that came with the unit lasted 4,733 copies and printouts--the drum cartridge still has 74% left on it. The toner cartridge and drum cartridge cost about $60-$70 each.This machine would probably also have the stamina for a larger operation, although I haven't put mine through the workload of more than a single-user environment.

But someone had mentioned in their review that this table works great for a larger laptop and that was the selling point for me. Of a lot of the laptop tables out there similar to this, I was having a hard time getting concrete info about what size laptops would fit on them. Having finally found the words I needed to hear and a decent price point, I decided to go with this table.It is not a very good fit for a 17 inch laptop. I am writing this using my 17 in Asus laptop in conjunction with the table, but it is significantly bigger than the ""cooling area,"" not leaving me much room to use my mouse (I don't care for the touch pad and prefer to use a wireless mouse). I have my laptop overlapping the edge of the table by about 1 inch, and overlapping the mousepad area by about 2-2.5 inches. I'm left with about 4 or so inches of space to move my mouse around. And it works out for me...sort of....but I was hoping for a little better.Even though my laptop is too big for the table though, it does keep it cool. The fan is very quiet and comes with a USB cable that you can store inside the table while not in use. I took cue from another user and started storing my external hard drive in that little compartment while using my laptop too. It keeps things neat and out of my way. And so I'm not sitting on the sofa surrounded by extraneous cables and techie paraphernalia haha. I'm also able to keep my cell phone near me and charge it using one of the USB ports on the side of the table. That's a nice convenience. I can't attest much to the LED light because I haven't had any use for it.When moving the table top to an inclined position, my laptop, although big for the table, stays in place with two plastic tabs that pop up. I enjoy this position, it is very comfortable to put the table on my lap without using the legs while sitting in bed this way.Overall, this is a very sturdy table. You might be weary because it is simply plastic, but the sturdy build is one thing I was impressed with when I took it out of the box. I just won't recommend it for 17 inch laptops.

The P2055dn, like the P2015d, works great with my Macs and printing wirelessly while connected to an Airport Express, and directly via USB.Because my P2015d died prematurely, and because the problem with that model was widespread and widely documented, I purchased a 3-year extended service plan from HP (hpshopping.com, HP product #UK929A) for around 60 USD, which essentially extends the warranty two years beyond the included one-year warranty. I'd recommend anyone buying a P-series LaserJet get an extended service plan: these printers work great, but are built somewhat cheaply, using lower-quality materials than HP's top-of-the line, business-oriented laser printers costing 1000 USD and up.It's a shame to reward HP for their poor craftsmanship by buying another one from them, but for the year and a half the P2015d worked, it worked flawlessly. For my needs, this printer in combination with the extended service plan is the right balance of cost, performance, and longevity.--**UPDATE 2013-09-17**Nine months to a year ago (soon after my extended warranty expired, alas), my P2015d started creating ghosted images on prints.

In fact, it is extremely well made and so useful that using my laptop without it now seems a chore, deficient in screen view, hand position, cooling of the laptop and overall comfort.  I am pleasantly surprised at the unit itself and how much of a difference it makes in using my laptop in both standing and sitting positions.

To me this suggests defects in some samples but not overall poor construction or design.  I do not find this product overpriced at all -- as long as it is functional.Contrary to some reviews, the main parts of the legs are made of robust aluminum as is the top platform.  The ends of the legs where the angles are adjusted ARE plastic, and there are plastic gear-like elevations that no doubt help it stay in place. I've found the spring-loading of the buttons to be just the right amount, and suspect the plastic is more slippery and less likely to stick than if that part was also aluminum.It seems this is an excellent product, generally well-made, but that inspection/quality control may have allowed too many (~10% ?) units with defective buttons to be sold. Should any sticking occur, I'd urge people NOT to use force to make it release but be sure to change adjustments often during initial weeks of use to expose any defects in the spring-loaded parts so so that a replacement can be requested while still on warranty (something earlier advised by ""JC"").  In previous reviews it seems that those with such problems have them very early or (one example) after the table was left in one position (buttons not used) for a prolonged period from initial use.

I would highly recommend Sakura and Gelly Roll pens, but it might be worth it to buy smaller packs with the colors you really need.  The reason I say that is there are some colors in this set that may not be useful to many artists or - in my case - colorists.  ;-)  My daughter and I color together and we use some of the more adult coloring books (art, patterns, intricate animal details, etc...) and the colors with silver or gold mixed in with them aren't as useful, but make up a large portion of the set.Also, this set does have the color chart (that you fill in yourself) included with it, which is GREAT, but could also be better.

We homeschool our two oldest and with two young kids working on handwriting everyday outside a classroom environment where pencils are used up and not lost we found ourselves using up the erasers on the pencils long before the pencil itself. These work great and eliminate the need to have the kids keep a separate eraser in front of them (and keep those big erasers off the floor where the baby can chew on them!). The price is very, very reasonable for so many and they last so long that I can't see needing to buy more in the next decade or so. They are so durable that they can be transfered from one pencil to the next for weeks. A ten pack would be ideal, plenty to last through the year but for the great price on the big box I can't complain.

I liked the blue lit keypads and HD quality it advertised, as well as the voice announce CallerID.  The blue backlight is great, but it's ONLY on the numbers - not pick up/hang up/speakerphone - ones you use frequently.  The sound quality is slightly better than my Panasonic which was purchased in 2006.  It's not HD by any stretch of the imagination.  Voice Announce CallerID - has a LONG way to go.  It can pronounce a name that is not too common (Tonya) perfectly, but the word Home comes out as, well, something I can't even describe.  While you can have a different ring tone on each handset, the base ringer is preset and cannot be adjusted.  This means your handset in the base will ring with one tone and the base will ring with another.  You can turn the volume all the way down on the base (this ring tone I don't care for), but then you cannot screen calls or listen to messages at the base since the ringer and voice volume control is one and the same.  Bad design flaw.  The phone book requires you to manually enter all names using the keypad - time consuming at best.  Batteries take hours to charge (manual says 10 but mine took 14) - be prepared to wait before you can use the phone.My phone was delivered with the base banged up.  I got a quick replacement from Amazon and thought I could just switch out the bases only - not possible.  The 3 headsets come pre-registered to the base already in the box, so you need to replace them all - they are not interchangeable.  I called VTech customer support to see if I could do something to just switch the base out - the rep assured me I could without losing information (all ring/volume, etc. settings and phone numbers).  I did as he instructed and I not only did I lose everything, but my handsets were numbered 4-6 (should've been 1-3) and when I went to use the intercom feature, it was showing I had 6 handsets when I only had 3.  I ended up de-registering all and using the ones that came with the new base to solve the proble (otherwise your phone is looking for handsets that don't exist).As always, Amazon support was exceptional on sending me a replacement immediately.  The VTech customer support, however, is like most ""technical support"" today - lacking in knowledge on their own product.  This phone is a good value for the price, but lacking in the features it proclaims to have (HD Audio) and still uses antiquated means in today's modern world (entering the address book manually).

The Print Image Matching attracted me being an owner of the Sony DSC-F707. I got it home and set it up in about 5 minutes which was a smooth process.After 15 minutes of reading the manual about PIM2 I fired up the plug-in and prepared to make my first borderless print onto a sheet of included complimentary 4x6 glossy paper. I made the mental note to not waste ink and get all settings correct the first time. Print Image Matching made this easy. I followed the steps, finalized print settings and pushed the button.

I regret suggesting this printer to others once I found out how hard it is for the average person to make a great print. The science of making a good ink-jet print is a mysterious hidden concept that Epson does not want you to know. The more failed prints you make, the more ink you have to buy at these outrageous prices. The software Epson includes is awful, and they don't even provide a basic Photoshop template for making CD/DVD prints. They force you to use a CD printing application that is non-standard and confusing. Don't bother making prints at home, just use ofoto.com. Head clogging, wasted ink, and wasted paper are going to make your prints cost over $2 each in the long run.

What you have here is a photo Box that gives your iPhone the ability to photograph 3 1/2""x5"" or 4""x6"" pictures, or slides and negatives. You  put in a 4""x6"" photo, then you put your iPhone on top of the unit. You push the button for the light in side the box, put your photo into the tray (Using software you download) and you see it on your phone display. The key they worked out is the distance from iPhone to image, so you don't need to worry about anything not being aligned or movement of your hand when you are shooting your images. The light has a good enough color to make your images look somewhat balanced, but you have the ability to balance them through the software on the iPhone. Right after you shoot and review your shoot you can put the iPhone on the Cube printer and have a picture in less time then it takes me to do on my professional equipment. I don't have to much hope for the slides or negatives looking too good, cause my slide scanner is true resolution of 3800 DPI and it is a pretty good one for small slides and negatives.

This my first Brother. I was very skeptical. Now I see It's worth at least 10 times the price. I usually keep my cool on finds like this. But I really want to see Brother crack the market here. HP/Canon/Epson  is a letdown most of the time. I've had every brand of MFC, Scanner and Copier. And going back to the early 90s starting with Canon laser copier / printers the size of half a car. I've seen it all. After years of only partial satisfaction with HP and EPSON machines, Brother has made me a believer in the future of cheap consumer stuff and more so in the Brother brand. For $250 (street price as of 5/09), I simply have never seen a machine to date that can DO SO MUCH and competently to boot. As a professional publisher and archiver -- I don't usually consider inkjets at all.. ever. But Brother's inks are cheap. And, what will really blow your mind how cheap aftermarket refills and continuous ink feed systems are available. That means endless , self feeding ink. That could theoretically drop this machine to the cost per page of a laser!Now, normally I would never touch scanners without rated optical density (ie DMAX). But , heck this scanner looks great! An I don't need to fuss with settings like I do with a 5 year old  $2000 UMAX (yes it's better looking I admit).Lots of reviews on the internet totally miss the point of this machine. It SCANS large stuff, like big books and brochures. The ADF can even feed big stuff - they thought of everything!!Overall: Much better software drivers than HP or Epson usually supply. Works great with MAC OSX. Something you cannot count on from HP. Brother has taken a quantum leap here. They included a set of real manuals. The ink carts are much more generous than I even seen to date in any inkjet. I believe they are breaking out of the Gillette business model (sell cheap printer so you by the high $ ink).Printer:1) Rips big graphics faster than my HP CM1017 laser and rasterizes (renders) the output beautifully.2) Prints POSTER size stuff.3) Prints over WiFi4) Good / easy printer setup.5) 2  huge paper trays. Man, you like will never run out of paper.Scanner:1) Looks good. Scans fast even high res 600dpi.2) Scans big stuff 11x17. This is rare capability boys & girls! Big $$ normally.3) YOU NEED NO COMPUTER, archive directly to PDF -- Grandma hates the PC? Just make your settings,  tell her to press Scan, OK next page. Scan 100 or 1000 pages to a JUMP DRIVE or mem card! Store indefinitely.4) Scans straight to the internet FTP address (last time I checked Xerox wanted big $ for this)5) Scans over WiFi -- a cherry on top.6) Scan a big book 2 UP and reduce to one page or do a 4 in one, save paper and finish big jobs quick.It has an ADF for easy scan jobs. Saves time.Oh, and all of the complaints about size? C'mon folks. It perches easily on the corner of a table. I have compared it's size to that of HP/Canon with nowhere near the capabilities. And it is really hardly any larger footprint wise. If you want a cheap and capable rig, make the room.The BAD you ask? Any complaint you could make here would fly with the OTHER BRANDS TOO. So for $250 no complaints.  It's consumer grade. Inkjets are not as good as lasers. But I am asking myself if it's time to compromise.Yes it has BUGS, foibles etcs. All gear does. But it's reliable. So if you need any of the above features -- it's a NO BRAINER. You're getting so much here, it's crazy.Don't forget to use a MAC with native PDF support. It's a great combo.So, Amazons' price is good. What are you waiting for?",5,Brother wins... best ever MFC !,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",677,18,19,0.947368421,helpful

469743,A2R5SM2C87PDOQ,B001GBKTGM,GothCrone,"[14, 18]","Rather disappointed in this item I must say.  I did considerable research before choosing this item to purchase.  I am a Mac user, running 10.4.11 (Tiger) with a PowerPC chip (which means, no upgrade for me to Snow Leopard, but that's unrelated to this review).First of all, like quite a few others, I do find the placement of the power and USB cord connections to be somewhat clumsey...requiring, no matter where I orient it to my Mac, to have cables pulled around the side which interfere a little bit, unless they're tucked back perfectly carefully, with the scanner lid itself.Secondly, the 3rd party software bundled with the Epson software is annoying -- the ArcSoft Media Converter software is 1) useless (from what I can tell anyway), and 2) annoying in that it sits up in the corner of my screen nagging me about various things and well...I uninstalled it and deleted it (and it did go away - many Windows users seem to not be able to be able to get rid of it at all - so I am grateful for small mercies).Third, even though there is a quick-start, ""start here"" 1 page guide included, it is so ""windows-centric"" that you sort of have to muddle around to figure out what to do to launch the software install on the Mac (not difficult to do, but still...)....and even though I don't expect a 400 page user's manual to be included in products anymore these days, SOMETHING would have been nice that had a bit more detail than the ""Start Here"" page....and here's my biggest disappointment - and this is probably my fault for assuming this, and my fault for not realizing that it wouldn't be something they'd include, ...there is no really smooth integration with iPhoto.  (I am using iPhoto 08). So unlike my creaky old HP5610 printer/scanner all-in-one, which scans directly into iPhoto using what they call (as the final step in the scan) the HP iPhoto ""dropper"", where I can just pick up and drop my photo thumbnails that the HP just scanned directly into iPhoto, this Epson V300 doesn't.  It opens up the ""my pictures"" folder and a nebulously named little file shows up called img001 (without a preview of the actual picture which could be my view settings in the My Pictures folder, but I've never cared before because my pictures with the HP don't land in the My Pictures folder)...so each time you scan you get img001 and then img002, etc., which presumably means you will have to keep up with the numbers to recognize which number you just scanned in. . . . . . and THEN one has to drag drop that one image into iPhoto and THEN there it is.  Too many steps in my opinion.So - not that thrilled.  I bought this to scan (probably thousands) of 35mm slides my grandfather took in the 50s, 60s, 70s etc., that I've inherited.  It probably will be okay for that, seems like the actual scanning works (although I did a test scan of the print that I scanned in on the HP5610 and compared it to the Epson V300 and the HP5610 was much better in color and just looked nicer (I used same resolution and same settings re color correction etc.,)So - the HP5610 stays as the main scanner.  And the Epson V300 will be used for the slides.  I am disappointed because I was hoping it would be faster/better for all scans than the HP5610.  But it's not faster (although it is not slow at all - no complaints there) and it is not better.  And ease of use, smooth interface with iPhoto is simply NOT there.UPDATE: I returned this item two weeks ago ... final straw was when I was scanning in black/white prints and they ended up super dark and with strange artifacts in the scan...nothing I could do would fix it...and I've never seen anything like that happen before.  So back it went.

While not without some flaws, this is the best trimmer I have used.After a couple of negative experiences with some cheaper trimmers, I bit the bullet and got this one.  Yes, it is more expensive, but it is also better designed than the other ones I have used.  It cuts very consistently and is accurate even when cutting through 20 sheets of 120gsm paper.  Basically, this seems like a great paper cutter, so I will just outline the cons.CONS:* cost* the guides, while square with the blade and usable, are made from molded plastic and so they have a couple of small spots where they pull away from the guide edge by &lt;1mm or so* the movable magnetic guide could be a little bit better made both in form to fit the side guides and in they way it is constructed (also molded plastic)* the light gathering plate, while useful, makes it very difficult to make cuts that are less than 3.5 inches wide, particularly if the amount you are trimming off is small* the ruling marks could be a little finer to make it easier to measure accurate cuts* the cutting mat strip seems like it may wear a bit quickly, but I did cut quite a lot of paper with it so farAside from these minor issues, this paper cutter works very well.  I had read one complaint about the way the blade has to be locked and unlocked for every cut.  This is true, but in the same way that my manual transmission car requires me to put it into gear and use the clutch every time I want to go anywhere.  In both cases the upshot is better control.When locked down the guide held the paper securely and the blade cut effortlessly, requiring no downward pressure at all, although cutting many layers requires more than one pass.",5,Initial impressions,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",334,15,16,0.9375,helpful

It is that easy to set up. It is by far the easiest way of using Skype. And DECT does not interfere with your 802.11b/g network.These two big advantages : no PC required (not even for setup) and it works with both Skype and land line. It doesn't seem to support 3 party calls to land line and skype with 1 handset, but I did not try very hard and I did not read the manual.Voice quality is good to average. There is a 2.5mm headset jack, but I haven't tried it.All cables are included. Nice change from printer manufacturers. The handset runs off 2 AAA NiMH batteries (included), so you don't need to get those expensive cordless phone batteries when they start to die.The whole thing looks plasticky. Yes, it is plastic, but there are many grades of plastic. This is definitely not iPod grade (or even iPEVO Free-1 grade).Source code for the firmware is available from Netgear. Go to Netgear support site and search for GPL. I have not tried it myself.I've only encountered a few minor irritations. I wish I can rate it 4.5 stars - it deserves more than 4 stars. And some of the problems should be firmware fixable.1. After I finish a land line call, the unit seems to restart. Never happens with Skype calls. My firmware version is 1.0.4.30 dated 11-29-2006. Hardware version 4.10.610.2. No phonebook for land line calls. You can add a SkypeOut contact and call through landline though.3. Ergonomics (or lack of) of the handset.4. In speakerphone mode, mic is weak.5. No answering machine.6. Your time is always shown on your contacts' screen as GMT +0. Time displayed on handset is correct (provided you set your time zone correctly).7. When the light on the handset goes off, it is completely dark. Good for battery life, I guess. But hard to figure out if it's off (battery dead - there is no off button) or just in power savings mode.8. Not sure what happened once with a new contact : I accepted a contact using the handset, then 5 minutes later I rebooted the base unit (moved it to a different location) and the contact was lost. It eventually recovered.9. It'll be nice if you can program it to show you as unavailable some hours of the day.

So far, I have not had any trouble with paper jams, but expect to pay the price when it comes to replacing the drum.  All in all, this is a capable machine that produces high-quality black and white images and text.The printing speed is much faster than that of my old HP, although newer and more expensive models will have increased print speeds.  I like that the paper tray can hold a whole ream of paper without jamming, and that communication between computer and printer seems reasonably efficient.  Printing web pages does not take long, as I did on my HP.  Best of all for me, this printer is Mac OS X compatible with no additional hardware needed; older Macs should also have no trouble.  I have been able to print more than a hundred pages in one session without jamming or other issues.  The print itself is high quality, as one would expect from a laser printer.I do get annoyed with the power saver feature, which I haven't yet figured out how to turn off.  After approximately ten minutes of non-use, the printer turns off, requiring the user to flip the power switch off and then back on.  Rebooting takes approximately 30 seconds.I give this model three stars instead of four primarily because the manual is explicit about eventually requiring drum replacement, a necessity that will cost almost as much as the printer itself.

The good news is the customer support time is only 5 minutes, the bad news is I have called them... too many times (and no one knows how to fix the problems, they keep transferring you to a different tier or technician).I have spent at least 15-20 hours (literally) on the phone with the techs. Just to get my phone set up took 3 days and I talked to 10 people (that alone took 7 hours). Normally, I am not that patient, but I was so excited about these phones and service, but at some point I couldn't take it any more. I was going to send it back but Bill Birnie, the man in charge of Panasonic Cloud, called me and did everything he could so I would give one more try with the best tech guy there and offered to send me a free phone. They sent me to the best tech, still couldn't get it, and the boss of the tech said if I gave him one more try he would send me $100 Visa gift card. I love incentives- But I never got the phone nor the gift card. $1000 wouldn't be worth the troubles I have had with this phone. It's wonderful for the 70% of the time it works. It's just the rest of the time that it doesn't work.I also have a few more problems with the information they give you before you sign up. I was concerned switching to a VoIP phone, so I read their FAQ's carefully. I wanted to make sure that I could take my phone number with me- it said I could :""Can I keep my current phone number?Yes, you can.

The only hitch is the setup...I knew from reviews online that setting up the wireless on this printer would not be easy. In fairness to Samsung, I've never seen a wireless printer yet that worked out of the box. But SHEEZ, the manual is next to useless, and Samsung's phone support IS useless (they blamed it on my wireless router). Once you know how to do it, the wireless setup ain't so bad. HERE'S HOW:Hook up the Samsung via ethernet wire to your router. Turn it on and wait a couple of minutes so it can get assigned an IP address via DHCP, then install the software. Look at your wireless router's setup screen to see what the printer's IP address is. Now enter the printer's IP address in your web browser, and the printer's setup screen will appear. Change the printer's IP address to a fixed address, then do the same on your router. You MUST use a fixed IP adress! Print a test page to make sure you are good so far.Now go to the printer setup's network setting\wireless menu. Oddly, the printer software couldn't see my wireless router (which is 2 feet away!) with the ""wizard"", but could see my neighbor's weak signal. IGNORE this and any ""not connected"" errors - go to ""custom"" and manually enter in the SSID name of your wireless system, use the infrastructure setting, and apply. Unplug the ethernet cable, and you're done. Print a test page to be sure. Install the software on every computer that will need to print to the Samsung.I used no encryption, although it is supported (I've read the Samsung prefers the WPA variety). One more tip: my manual didn't even say how to print a configuration page! Just hold down the big button (OK, the ONLY button!) on the Samsung for 10 seconds to print it. BTW, I use Macs, and it prints fine from OS 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6. The printer came right up in Bonjour when I went to add the printer on each Mac - it couldn't be easier. Setup should be about the same on Windows PCs, although probably not as easy as a Mac (like everything else!).The Samsung printer works perfectly out of the box wired, and comes with the toner carts pre-installed. The carts are on the small side, I imagine they won't last long if you print a lot. There's no LCD or setup buttons on the printer, and you won't need 'em. B&W; print quality is great and quick. Color quality was pretty good too, despite what I've read elsewhere. There was that copier ozone smell the first night I used the Samsung, but it was gone after a day. The Samsung is also WAY smaller than the competition, and I love having a built-in power supply. I'm very VERY pleased with it overall.Hope this helps someone out there! And Samsung: I'm available if you need help rewriting your manuals - and you do.Mick",4,"Incredible value, TOUGH wireless setup",1256169600,"10 22, 2009",514,23,24,0.958333333,helpful

I was almost ready to purchase one. But then I started reading reviews. And thank goodness I did.I read about issues with HP customer support. And that jogged my memory.

We'll be using it largely for printing text, school projects, etc.  But I will also printing photos for scrapbooking when I only have relatively few to print and don't want to wait for mail order or don't want to drive to my local retailer to use their photo kiosk.  For my purposes, the print quality looks good on text documents and excellent on photos (Since I'm a scrapbooker so photo quality is important to me.) It prints quickly enough for my needs.But one weird thing that I think I've read elsewhere is that the printer shakes the desk when it prints a text page. My desk is large, made of solid wood and filled with files, extra paper and other supplies so you would think it would stand still as the printer runs. Printing a color web page was quick and quiet. But when I did the text page, the printer was a little clunky and loud and it made my desk shake as the page was printed. Unfortunately, I didn't print a text page in the store when I was doing my research.  I might have chosen a different printer if I had known, but it's not annoying enough (yet?) to make me mad.I'll be moving the printer to a separate stand anyway because the printer is so large, but I hope the printer doesn't make that stand shake as well. I only gave it 4 stars because of the shaking. How many others are having this problem?UPDATING:  11/1/11Uses color ink even when printing in grey scale!  I printed a number of pages today for the first time since I got the printer.  I've printed about 50 or so pages of text that  have large amounts of white space.  The ink levels on the color ink tanks were the same when I started, but when I was done, the ink levels in the cyan and magenta were low and had warnings on them.  How could the color ink run low when I made it a point to choose greyscale printing on every job?  I noticed that the printer does some kind of adjustment between jobs.  I hope these aren't cleaning cycles.  As someone else pointed out, the cleaning cycles use up ink, including color,each time it happens.  Yikes!  Revising my rating from 4 stars to 3.  I'm starting to regret this purchase.  And yes, it also shakes the solid wood media stand that it sits on.  What is up with that?UPDATING:  2/28/12I've only had this printer since October and I just bought my 3rd set of cartridges - all the colors and blacks.  And I've printed fewer than 100 4 x 6 photos!  This thing really does hog up ink even if you mostly print black and white text.  I called Canon Support and they told me that the printer uses the color ink to make a composite black.  Why would they do that?  There are two black ink cartridges in this printer.  I assumed one was for text and one was for photos.  According to Canon Support you can change the printer settings to not use the color ink to make black.  I encourage you to call and complain that these aren't the default settings and ask them how to set your printer up to print using the black ink for black and white pages!!!  And beware that your print quality may not be good based on their instructions.  They won't tell you that you have to play with the ""custom"" settings to set the print quality to a higher quality.  Even at the higher quality setting, they text is not the dark black you get from the composite black that uses up so much ink.

When I got them, though, I was really impressed.These are literally 1/16th of an inch thick (I know because I stacked up 16 of them and measured that it was an inch), which makes them quite sturdy.  They aren't brittle, so if you do try to bend them, they won't snap (they aren't really meant to be bent, though, and I'm not entirely sure why anyone would want to - mainly I'm saying that you won't accidentally snap one in two if you kick it in the garden).The plastic is white, with a slight texture to it (texture is on both sides).  If you write on the labels with a sharpie or similar, the writing is clear, and doesn't smear - seems instantly dry.  There is a small hole punched near the ""pointy"" end of the labels, so if you wanted to poke a wire tie or similar through and loop it around a branch or small trunk for use as a hanging tag, these should work well.  The pointy end is rounded off at the point.  You won't scratch yourself or your plants with it, unless you're actively working at causing some damage.For seedlings, I cut them in half at an angle (so that I have a pointy end to stick in on both halves, not just the half that would end up with the original pointy end), because I wanted to be able to use these with seedlings in a covered tray.

Well, the winning streak is over.  Unless you have really low expectations, I think this device is going to not do the job you're expecting.  I didn't expect miracles, but I thought I might at least get quality approaching what I get with my 8 year old Epson Perfection 4180 flatbed scanner.  Not so.  I even rescanned a few times with different exposure settings, but the Wolverine never compared will to the old Epson.First of all, the things I knew would be less:  This device creates 8 bit per channel JPEGs, and that's it.  My old Epson flatbed will do that or 8 bit TIFFs or 16 bit TIFFs.  For convenience, I could live with that.  Here's the rest of the story, though.Contrast.  Wolverine scans are very contrasty compared to the Epson.  It's easy to enhance contrast in a photo editor--not so easy to reduce contrast, so this is a problem.Noise.  The above contrast also increases the obvious grain in many slide films.  The scanned images are very noisy.  Even using Noise Ninja in Photoshop, I could not get the Wolverine scans to look as good as the Epson scans.Adjustments.  The Epson offers unsharp mask, noise reduction, restoration, brightness and contrast, plus dpi from 300 to 12800.  The Wolverine offers luminance overall and per color channel.Speed.  The Wolverine is faster, but it scans only one at a time.  The Epson holds four, and it scans them each independently.  At the same settings as the Wolverine, the elapsed time is comparable for four slides.  If you take advantage of the Epson 16 bit per channel scanning, it takes much longer--but you end up with a better scan.All in all, I have to say for very casual users--those who are happy with their iPhone pictures, for example--this is probably OK.

Better change that password and update all of the computers on your network, or you cannot use this printer. After contacting tech support, both by phone and by Live Chat, I got the same answer - call your router company and change your password, or your only &#34;solution&#34; is to just use this printer on a single computer with a cable (*not included).  That is NOT a &#34;solution&#34; - that is a hack, and a pretty poor one at that, particularly if multiple users need to print from multiple computers.

I was able to get basic printing up and running, and can scan (slowly, and laboriously) through Photoshop, but I guess I will have to wait for them to fix their site to actually be able to do it through Control Center in a more efficient way.The entire experience was incredibly frustrating, their tech support was completely useless and unhelpful, and I felt like I was trapped in 1998.

Accousti,"[8, 10]","Just started using the printer so this is not a long term review but we were looking for a quiet, color laser printer that would work wirelessly with our portable devices ( iPhones, iPads) and with my wife's MacBook laptop in a house with 3 separate routers (3 different SSIDs). This printer took all of 20-30mins to set up and print from right out of the box.  It worked perfectly and the quality of the print is what you'd expect from a laser printer. The duplex printing worked flawlessly. The printer worked immediately with the iPhone and iPads without any problem and the MacBook laptop only required straightforward driver install off the supplied CD-ROM.  The most important thing was that it printed from computers linked to different network SSIDs so I could print from upstairs on a different network!  I can't speak to the longevity of this particular printer because we've only had it one day but I have used another model Brother B&W Laser printer in my office for 12 years now with only a laser drum changes and not a single hiccup!  I can't say the same for the Minolta Color laser that this one is replacing that lasted just 4 years.  We'll see about this one. It is really very quiet which is another bonus. The Minolta was so loud it would sound like someone was breaking into our house at night when it would wake from sleep mode.  Very happy with ease of setup, wifi functionality on Apple mobile and OS products and quality of print and the added bonus of duplex double sided printing. No negatives to report yet but will update this when we have more experience with it. Oh BTW I never had to hook this thing up to a computer for setup (it doesn't even come with a USB cable - although you can do that but only wifi or cable can be used at any one time). I simply plugged it into the wall, used the LCD screen to let the built in WLAN wizard find the various Wifi networks (even the neighbors SSIDs showed up) and selected the strongest one, entered the password, and that was the whole setup.

Unfortunately, I ignored the reviews about slow scanning because I thought the other reviewer were talking about copying.  I'm interested in scanning old documents into the computer so I can throw the paper away.  Well, this thing really slows down after 30+ pages of scanning (into the computer).  I don't think it is a memory problem because I can see the pages showing up on my PC.  They are not stored in the printer.  I also don't think it is a warm up issue because the unit must be warmed up already from scanning 30+ pages.I actually think it could be a cool down problem.  After the scanner goes into slow mode, I leave the computer to do something else.  When I return, the scanning is done, and I can start another scan job.  This will scan very fast for another 30+ pages, and then it slows down again.  So, I go do something else again.  I can't believe the printer is warming up when I'm doing something else so that it can go back into fast scanning mode.  It almost seems that it got too hot from continuous scanning.  When I go away, it cools down so it is able to resume fast scanning.  This is purely a guess on my part.The setup is fairly easy.  I have not tried networking yet.  Nor have I printed any pictures yet.  The first thing that I need to do is to scan a bunch of documents.  The scanning software is pretty good.  It will let you scan two-sided documents into PDF files by scanning one side and then the other side.  The software merges the pages together so there is minimal effort on your part.  Where it can be improved is in moving the scanned images around (relative to the other images) before writing the PDF file.  You can do it, but it is not very friendly.I think I'm going to keep this printer only because it is such a hassle to return it to Amazon.

123109,A3AZEH6AYN7TLP,B00024VTKY,"Rick ""lensman""","[17, 18]","One motivation for writing this review is some important misinformation in a previous review. At any rate, I could not decide between the OKI 5200 and the HP 2600. At my local office supply store, they sat side-by-side, and thanks to two different $100 rebate offers (one instant, one mail-in) for the OKI, they were the exact same price. My decades-long favorable experiences with everything HP I had purchased (including a mono laser printer) had me strongly leaning toward the HP. The sample test prints made by each showed them very close in quality, with the HP doing a slightly better job at printing graphics. A big difference is that the OKI's prints are high gloss. Even the lettering is gloss, when printing no graphics, on plain white paper. So imagine every letter you print with the OKI having glossy black type regardless of what paper you use. If that's something you like, the OKI will not disappoint. For normal use, I personally find it a bit strange. It so happens that I was buying the OKI primarily for the printing of color brochures, and the glossy output was perfect for that. So I went with the OKI against my better judgement, but in love with the glossy prints.I really don't know whether I made the right decision, all things considered, because I don't have the HP 2600 to compare against. The OKI has an enormous footprint making it difficult to find a place to park it. It also weighs 50+ pounds. The HP has a great and stylistic design that allows a MUCH smaller footprint. Something to keep in mind before you purchase, as it's a problem for me now. I am going to obtain a separate low cart and place the OKI on that.The various toner cartidges inside the OKI are horizontally arranged. Lifting the long cover to its full height (requiring a lot of free space to do so), one then reaches over the long bank of toner cartridges to access the rearmost colors. The HP 2600, on the other hand, has an extremely easy access design, with all the cartridges available at the FRONT of the printer, in vertical array.The OKI does produce oustanding text (with the warning that it is high gloss and there's nothing you can do about it) that is crisp and clean down to small font sizes. Printing photos is another story. Relative to other color laser printers in this price range, small photos (which I use a lot of for brochure printing) print about average. However, the OKI photo printing would not even match a cheap inkjet printer from five years ago. There are several color printing tweaks available, and I found that using the OKI's sRGB color space worked a bit better than the other settings. Color lasers have a long way to go when it comes to quality photo printing. They key is to keep the photos small, somewhere under 3"" x 3"" .The OKI build construction is good. Preparing for first-time use requires about 25 minutes of removing tapes, straps, and shipping blocks located all over, under and inside the unit. Be certain to keep the cartridges level in your hands whilst you're removing all the protective tapes from it. I managed to spill some cyan toner on my pants. Driver installation went perfectly, in contrast to some aggravating hacking I've had to do when installing HP laser printer drivers.The OKI fired up properly (if noisily) the very first time, and the intitial test page was perfect. While the print speed is quite good, the warmup time is not. The HP will get you prints from a cold start much quicker -- but the printing speed is slow.Documentation includes a handy and useful booklet that attaches to the side of the printer. The manual itself is lacking in detail. The setup guide was ambiguous and not very helpful.The built-in Ethernet card is a nice addition, but also found on other color lasers in this price range. Setup for this part is intimidating and not for the faint of heart.I use 65 pound stock for the brochures I print, which means I have to use the Multi Purpose Tray to load the sheets, and flip open a rear paper stacker so that the stock shoots straight through the printer and out the back. Recall that the printer footprint is already deep, and now I have to allow another foot of room for the sheets to feed out the back. Further, the Multi Purpose Tray is very kludgy to use.Now for the sobering aspect of OKI ownership (and other color lasers as well). There is bad news, and worse news. Bad -- it costs more to purchase a new set of toner cartridges than it cost to purchase a new OKI. The high capacity (5k pages, NOT 50k as mentioned in a previous review) toner cartridges for this printer are $62 for black and $142.50 for the other colors. If you purchase the rainbow pack (all colors at once) you save 10% and pay a mere $440.15. Folks, I paid $400 for this printer brand new after mail-in rebate. Things get worse, as the OKI uses separate drums, one for each color also, and they cost $100 each as well. When you change a drum, OKI recommends you change the cartridge. OKI claims the drums are good for 50k pages. When you thought things couldn't get worse -- well, they do. OKI, unlike HP, is one of those companies that provides only a starter set of toner cartridges (rated at 3k pages). The ugly fact is that once you fork out the dollars for OKI 2600, in only 3k pages you'll be facing the peculiar decision of forking out $440.15 for new cartridges, or buying a new color laser for LESS. By 50k pages, you'll be needing some $845 to buy new drums and cartridges. Better start scouting out a convenient dumpster in which to unload your 50-pound hunk of plastic.The bottom line for me is that the OKI produces some great glossy brochures that just pop with crisp color. Unfortunately, it is not easy to print these brochures due to the kludgy Multi Purpose Tray. For other uses, especially if you're not seeking the glossy look for everything you print, you may want to check out the competition. I'm personally not looking forward to another major financial outlay at 3k pages, as detailed above.",3,Great glossy printouts - but - throwaway color laser?,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",1075,17,18,0.944444444,helpful

For the last few years the Epson 2200 had been my pride and joy but a few months ago I found a 1280 trashed on the side walk in Hollywood California and I am truly glad I pick it up. With a little T.L.C. I managed to clean out the nozzles and get it running. Reading a few of the reviews on this website I learned that the 1280 is an ink slayer and did my research on another product called Mediastreet Niagara Plug-N-Play System. Niagara Plug-N-Play is a bulk dye based ink system that works grate if not better than the factory inks. As a wedding photographer I need to print hundreds of prints at a time and the Epson 1280 with the Niagara System has been my most reliable printer set up till this day. In fact I am setting up another 1280 with the Niagara system for another one of my PC.Not: the 1280 will produce really nice prints at 11X17, and 13X19,But the 2200,because of its seventh color, still has much more detail around shadowy arias, but unless you put a magnifying glass up to it I do not think you'll notice it.",5,it's worth the invest ment,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",209,13,13,1,helpful

You never know for sure whether a fax is sent or not and it seems to ""lose"" about half of them.  The worst part is that you can't cancel a fax print job!  That's right! If some idiot sends you a 100 page fax, YOU CAN'T CANCEL IT!  It just keeps printing using up all your ink and paper.  Total piece of crap!***ORIGINAL REVIEW***Great machine.  Its the first drama-free fax machine I've owned.  Plug it in and it runs quietly, quickly, and dependably.  I had my main office printer go out so I downloaded a driver from the internet and hooked it up to my network to use as a backup printer.  It works so well, I just might keep using it as the office printer and the fax machine.  Really nice product.",5,"Okay Printer, Useless Fax",1180483200,"05 30, 2007",145,22,27,0.814814815,helpful
200944,A275SBU71E3YAE,B000DZEA2G,Adam Eberbach,"[26, 28]","I was a huge fan of these books, price just did not matter. They were the only ones with solid wire binding that would last the time the book was filled and beyond, the only ones with good solid covers hard enough to protect the contents. Most importantly they were absolutely top quality paper - suitable for fountain pen, felt-tip, pencil, it would probably even stand up to watercolors. The paper was a beautiful texture that showed absolutely no bleed-through and was also incredibly durable - repeated erasers, scotch tape, paper clips no trouble. This was my ideal notebook.I have just ordered and received another ten of these books to find that unlike my previous books (Made in USA) they are now Made in Mexico. The wire binding and covers seem to be a bit lighter gauge. That I could live with, but the paper is different. It is shiny and completely unlike the old books.If you are buying these books because you require a sequentially numbered wire-bound notebook and you don't much care about paper quality perhaps these are still OK.If you care about the paper, if you are a repeat customer because of the paper, look elsewhere. Try to find old stock of the USA-made books somewhere before I do. You might be much better off buying some Moleskine grid books and taking them to a bindery to have that superior paper rebound, or even work out something with your local paper supplier and bindery. I am very disappointed with my purchase.",2,WARNING! HECHO EN MEXICO! NOT THE SAME!,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",254,26,28,0.928571429,helpful

They came today, and two are PINK.  A pink binder is not shown in the item photo.  All it says is ""colors may vary.""  If I had known there was a chance we'd get pink, I would not have ordered them.  The other four are lime green.  He can tolerate that color, but four of the same color binders aren't going to be helpful when he's digging around in his backpack looking for a particular subject's binder.

I can have a phone in four different rooms (2 more can be added) and do not have to worry about being upstairs while having left my cordless phone downstairs.  Furthermore, each handset is slim, dark, and unobtrusive so that it fits in any setting.  The audible announcement of the caller allows me to know who is calling without my having to leave whatever I am doing to see if I even want to answer a call.  I can also set the entire calling system from ANY handset, not just the main one. If someone wants to update his/her cordless phone with answering machine, the Panasonic Dect 6.0 is the one to buy.

The print is perfect and I like how there is 4 different ink cartridges where you only have to replace the one you need (probably black first!) and save some money.  What I love more than anything is that I downloaded a free app from Epson where I can connect to my Iphone and print from it (pictures, webpages etc) straight to the printer.  I also set up remote print so that if I want to print from another location other than my house, I can do that also. It is assigned an email address that makes setup easy.  I can see this coming in very handy.  The printer its self is fairly small sized but it does what I need it to do.Pros:** Print from Iphone or work computer** Small sized so it doesn't take up a lot of room on my desk** Easy setup** Individual ink cartridges that are priced very economical** Multifunctional: Print, copy, scan, faxCons:None so far",5,setup in 30 minutes including Iphone!,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",180,23,26,0.884615385,helpful
