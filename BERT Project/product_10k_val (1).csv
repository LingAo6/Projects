Since then I've used it for everything when I actually had it.I abused this pencil when I was doing some carpentry work and it still works.I lost it in my metal tool case down in my basement and finally found it when I was getting rid of some old tools that didn't work anymore.

Couple of months later I found it while cleaning out the hair and dust on the refrigerators compressor.

119692,A1XFJOU6S7DK0C,B0001Q4I24,Joseph Isenbergh,"[54, 54]","This is the first scanner I've owned that does everything fast and well. For the past several years I've been scanning paper files to hard disk, to the end of achieving a paperless life.I bought 7 scanners between 1999 and 2005, including an Epson, an HP, 4 Visioneers, and the Xerox Documate 252. All were either sheet-fed or had document handlers. All but the Xerox Documate were fair to dismal.I used several of the previous scanners with a succession of Macs, while using others on a PC. For Macintosh the HP scanner software always proved dysfunctional. It failed outright a signficant part of the time. The HP hardware was similarly afflicted. The document feeder choked on a high proportion of documents run through it (for reasons I could neither fathom nor correct). The Epson worked slightly better, but was slow and clunky. Its document feeder frequently stuck, and gagged on something as minor as a slight crease in the paper.The Visioneers had these and other problems as well. Also, files created in the Windows environment on older versions of Paperport scanning software that was bundled with these scanners (Version 5.5, for example) almost always became corrupted in some way when I transferred them from a PC to a Mac, and vice versa. Therefore I had to keep my Mac and Windows scanned archives on separate computers.When I bought a Xerox Documate 252, it proved head and shoulders above any scanner I had previously owned or even seen. [The Xerox Documate does share the Visioneer nameplate, but as far as I can tell it has nothing in common mechanically with earlier Visioneers.] It makes one-sided or two-sided scans, in color, greyscale, or black and white. It is fast and accurate. The document feeder handles everything I throw at it (with very occasional paper jams). Also, the more recent versions of Paperport scanning software (9.0 and above) that are bundled with the Documate produce pdf files as the default scans. Pdfs transfer well between Mac and Windows. [Some file names do not transfer fully from Mac to Windows, but all file names transfer from Windows to Mac in my experience. Therefore it is better to do initial scanning in the Windows environment. That is necessary in any event with the Xerox Documate, which functions only on Windows operating systems. The Documate does work well, to my own knowledge, on an Intel-based Mac running Windows XP in Boot Camp. I don't know, however, whether that also obtains for Windows Vista in a similar configuration.]I got more useful scanning done in 4 weeks after I bought this device than I had accomplished in the previous 6 years.UPDATE: I've now used the Xerox Documate for over 3 years. It has lived up to its promise, and then some. I bought a second one for a different office; it has worked equally well. I have also bought a Fujitsu Scansnap S500. The Scansnap is a capable scanner, at half the price, but not in the same league with the Xerox Documate 252.There is one further development worth noting. The latest version of the Paperport scanning software (version 11.0, which I am now running on a Vista platform) handles paper jams more deftly. When the document feeder jams, the scanner now provides the option to save the pages already scanned to the Paperport Desktop and continue with the unscanned pages after unclogging the jam. This is a vast improvement over earlier versions, where a jam on the next-to-last page required a complete do-over. [I did not notice, unfortunately, exactly when this improvement kicked in, so I can't say specifically what level of upgrade is necessary to obtain it.]SECOND UPDATE September 26, 2009: I am updating this review to report that after 4 and 1/2 years the older of my two Xerox Documate 252s has faltered mechanically. The problem is that the roller in the document feeder does not reliably grip the pages of the documents that I insert for scanning. As a result the scanner sometimes just whirs for a time, then stops. The document must be reloaded at that point and the scanning restarted. It helps to press the documents down and against the feeder, but that defeats the self-executing element of the scanner. My conjecture is that the roller (which is made of rubber) has become harder and has shrunk a little, so that it no longer grips paper with as much friction as in its younger days -- a kind of mechanical equivalent of bone loss. In any event, my original Documate 252 is now in semi-retirement. I still use it for short documents that I can help along by hand through the feeder, but not for long sustained scanning jobs. I have replaced the Documate with a Fujitsu fi-6130, which I unpacked and set up today. When I've had more extended experience with the fi-6130, I'll review it on Amazon.com. Meanwhile, I did try a few quick scans earlier today and was tremendously impressed with the mechanical performance of the fi-6130 (although the software is distinctly unwelcoming and will take time to absorb).",5,Changed My Life,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",850,54,54,1,helpful

Finally I waited until Saturday and called customer support.  It turned out I needed to go ""Devices and Printers/Add a Printer/Add a Local Printer/Create a New Port/EpsonNet Print Port.  This instruction is nowhere in literature.Now wireless printing works, but wireless scanning only works when the printer is connected to the computer by USB cable.The ""Epson Connect"" software for remote printing does not install.  It ""cannot find"" the printer, despite the fact that wireless printing works.  The customer service rep suggested my Avast virus-protection freeware was probably causing the problem, or my Cisco router setup.  I'm no computer security expert but clearly those are last resort notions from a rep who doesn't know what he's talking about.  He asked me to do an installation on another computer in the house, and when the printer again couldn't be ""found"" he suggested the computer, 20 feet below the router through the floor, might be too far away from the router.  Again, clueless.I'm tempted to return the Epson and try a Brother, but what a hassle.  1-star until Epson debugs the software.Update October 14, 2013 - I strongly discourage anyone from buying this printer.  The wireless printing issue has never resolved itself.  Printing images in ""standard"" mode typically results in streaks across the picture, it's necessary to print in ""high"" mode to get a proper image.  Copy settings must be endlessly fiddled with to get a 1:1 image reproduction.  Today is yet another strike - I am printing an invoice from an email, and the printer prompts me to replace the cyan and magenta ink cartridges.  I don't need color so I change the setting to black and white, but again am prompted to replace the color ink cartridges.  I'm presented with two choices - buy Epson ink, or cancel, so I cancel and am punted back to start.  That is to say, I cannot print in black and white until I replace the color ink cartridges.  Now I am going to make this personal because it is deserved - It is absolutely unbelievable how a company's leadership and people can have so little pride as to put out such an incredibly poorly configured, poorly supported device such as this.  My only pleasure is in this buying replacement ink cartridges from a re-manufacturer instead of Epson direct.  Really a sad piece of equipment, do not buy, and I will not buy an Epson printer again.Update 12/29/13 - Starting a few weeks ago, the printer recently stopped laying down ink on the ""plain paper"" setting. I had to set the printer to ""glossy"" to lay down adequate ink.  It took 4-5 minutes to make a copy on this setting.  A few months ago I switched to generic ink cartridges.  They were compatible until today.  The printer now ""Cannot recognize"" the ink cartridges.  No surprise, the cartridges have plenty of ink but the printer still demands I reinstall them.  It's won't proceed, no longer functioning even as a copier.  One of the worst purchases I've ever made.  Wish I could rate it zero starts.Update 12/30/13 I just ordered theCanon PIXMA Printing Solutions MG7120 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One Printer, Cloud Enabled, Blackto replace this Epson printer that has been disappointed since day 1.  Looks like every multifunction printer sold on Amazon has a bunch of bad reviews, but this PIXMA seems to have the best ratio of positive to negative reviews.  I will Freecycle the Epson.Update 1/3/13 - I've installed the PIXMA.  Very nice looking machine, great copy and scan quality.  Easy installation.  The wireless connection installed perfectly.  The scanning software didn't install properly until I identified a conflict with Avast! Anti-Virus.  Now I'm fully installed, very relieved to be done with the Epson and with a working printer, easy to use, good output quality.",1,"buggy software, multiple installation problems, ongoing problems months later",1353110400,"11 17, 2012",660,106,127,0.834645669,helpful

(Note: I did not buy the ""Plus"" version, which only adds the ability to save directly to PDF. I bought my scanners before the Plus version became available. The software that came with my scanners does create PDFs as well, but not ""directly."" I'm not sure if the direct-to-PDF feature is worth the extra $30 or $40; it may be if it generates higher quality PDFs with smaller file sizes.) I've had both for more than three years. I've installed them on both Windows XP and Windows 2000 (English and Japanese versions). I have never had a scanner install and work so flawlessly. Despite what some of the other reviews say, I have found the software to be stable and totally crash-free. Previously I have used Epson and HP scanners, and in my opinion the OpticBook 3600 offers comparable scan quality with software that is more innovative and less intrusive, if primitive looking in spots. The software does what it's supposed to. Most notably, it allows you to scan each page of a book with just a touch of a button on the scanner, automatically rotating every other scan if you so specify in the settings.My scanners came with a light version of Abbyy's FineReader OCR software. I purchased an upgrade to the professional version for $100 or $150 (a free trial is available on Abbyy's web site), and I have found it to be excellent (well worth the price of the upgrade). I chose Abbyy over OmniPage because the latter doesn't provide a trial version (to my knowledge) and its activation policy struck me as too intrusive.One issue that I've had is that occasionally the scanner lamp inexplicably fails to turn on after the warm-up. This usually happens when I haven't used the scanner in a while, and the lamp always comes on after a reboot (once it took a couple of reboots). Scary the first time it happened, just a minor annoyance thereafter.Overall, a very well designed product. If you have any need to scan books, I think you will be impressed with the innovation that went into this scanner and its software. There's nothing comparable available that I've been able to find.One word of warning. After I bought these scanners I bought an HP Photosmart all-in-one color printer/scanner/copier. When I installed the HP, I found that the OpticBook no longer worked. I eventually figured out that I could use the OpticBook again if I disabled the HP under Imaging Devices in Device Manager. However, even when enabled under Device Manager the HP will not work as a scanner with the OpticBook installed (it only works as a printer). I really only needed a printer anyway, and I've found the HP software to be so intrusive, bloated and annoying that I've vowed to avoid all-in-ones from now on. As soon as I get a chance, I'm going back to my trusty HP LaserJet, which has the added advantage of not prompting me to buy color ink cartridges every time I blink.Finally, if you don't like this scanner, you might have to spring for one by a company called Kirtas. Watch this demo - it's a little scary:[...]",5,Great book scanner,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",541,11,12,0.916666667,helpful

My husband originally gave me this same desk several years ago, to use as a sewing table, so I'd have space for both of my machines.  During a recent move, we had to let go of a lot of our furniture, so I lost my beloved table.I just recently ordered this again through Amazon/CSN -- and I am so happy to have it again.  It is quite sturdy, folds up easily when/if you want to close it up, and is still an attractive piece of furniture when folded.The casters are good & sturdy.  The desk rolls easily when you need to move it, but stays put nicely when in use.  I had my embroidery machine running for lengthy amounts of time, with the desk on a hardwood floor - all the vibration of the machine never caused the desk to shift along the floor at all.  But it was easy enough to move the desk if I needed to.All in all, I think this is a great product for this price range.  MUCH better quality than most assemble-it-yourself furniture I've seen.It does take a bit of time to put it together - but once done, you have a great desk that is perfect for sewing, or could be used for so many other purposes.PLEASE NOTE: the desk does NOT have the pewter drawer handles as shown in the photo - the handles you will receive with the white desk are a cream color.  My first desk, from a few years ago, had the pewter handles, which I liked better.  I even called the manufacturer to see if I could buy another set of handles in the pewter, and they told me they no longer make the pewter handles at all.

1014025,A2AINLLX0560S1,B007CGULSQ,Graydon Blair,"[507, 517]","This is my 3rd Canon MFP. While I was contemplating other brands (because these things drink ink like crazy & I only get about 2 years out of them), I still am glad I went with another Canon.Here's why:Wireless Scanning AT THE MACHINE- Unlike the Epson, HP, and others, this machine will actually scan over wireless to the computer of your choice by pressing the Scan button on the machine (at the machine you're not restricted to just a USB connected device--Love it!)- You push the button, choose the type of scan (PDF, Image), and then you have the choice of choosing which network connected computer to scan to.- I have an iMac (with OS X AND Win7 on it via VM Ware), a MacBook Pro, an Acer Laptop, a Dell XPS, and a clone PC- If the computers are on and connected to my network, they all show up in a list to choose from- You choose the computer, then press SCAN and it starts to scan- I tried it on all my computers & platforms & it worked flawlessly! Great software!- I absolutely LOVE Canon's MP Navigator. It pops up, the scan is saved into it, and you're ready to use the file. AWESOME!!!Wireless Setup:- Super easy! Tell the machine you want to use Wireless and it looks for wireless access points (routers)- You select your router and enter a password if you use one (I do)- It then connects and that's it! You're done!To set up your computer to talk to the printer, just install the software & let it run through the install- Your computer will detect the printer and whoala! You're ready to print (or scan or fax) over wireless!- Canon definitely rocks in this department and setting up the MX892 over my MX860 for wireless was even simpler.Faxing:- Super simple. Plug in your phone line, and it's pretty much ready to fax- There's also quite a few settings (tone/pulse/phone priority/machine name & number registration, etc)- But right out of the box you can plug it in & it'll fax (I tried it. It worked!)Printing:- It prints quicker than my MX860 does- The ink tanks look a little smaller and if it's like the 860 I'm sure it'll eat through them like water- I notice the ink will evaporate if you don't use it (I don't print a lot & the ink just ""disappears"") I swear it's alcohol based- I bought off-brand ink for the 860 & never had a problem, I'm sure this will be the sameCopying:- Worked perfect!- Lift the lid, put something on the copy glass, select the # of copies, and press copy- Out comes your copy.- It has lots of bells & whistles (enlarge/shrink/scan to duplex, etc), but I just use it as a basic copier and it works greatSoftware:- Canon's printing software has to be some of the best out there. I've tried lots of others and I'm hooked on Canon- Super easy install, super easy to use, and it ""just works!"" Every time!- No hoky monkey business to scan or print or fax, just easy to use buttons to get you moving- There's some extra's in there (calendars, photo layouts, etc). I printed a calendar & it did pretty wellExtra's:- I tested some of the downloadable templates on the printer- The calender templates are pretty cool- I'm sure I'll be trying othersReliability:- Yet to be seen. I'm not holding my breath- My MX860 lasted just over 2 years before the internal power supply died- Came in one day & it was dead. No way to fix it. Hello garbage can!- My previous Canon MFP had the print head go bad- I've read that the HP's/Epson's/Brother's are more reliable & drink less ink, but the Canon functionality (being able to actually SCAN over wireless AT the machine) and ease of use of the software still make it work for me- I'd much rather have a machine that I can actually use & have to replace it every few years than fight & grumble with a ""reliable"" machine that won't do what I need it forThoughts:- If you're looking for an easy to set up, easy to use Multi-function printer, then look no farther. Setup couldn't be simpler and it just works. Every time!- The Canon MFP's do drink ink like it's going out of style (my MX860 actually EVAPORATED ink), so just use off-brand ink & call it good.- The machine is smaller than the Epson Workforce or the HP 8600 series (shorter) although it takes up just about as big of a footprint. But I like not having to use a stool to use the top of it- Time will tell how well this one will hold out, hopefully longer than the MX860, but I'm happy with it so far.[3 MONTH UPDATE 11/24/12]The printer is working absolutely flawlessly and I still love it!Printing:- Definitely prints faster than the old MX860 did- Print quality is noticeably better too- The cartridges seem to be lasting longer.- I'm still on my original set & they still have quite a bit of ink left- Maybe they finally fixed the evaporating disappearing ink issue! SWEET!!Scanning (Via Wireless AT THE MACHINE):- I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FEATURE!!!- It still works flawlessly- Stick something on the scan bed or in the automatic document feeder, press SCAN, and away it goes!- One improvement over my MX860 is that it remembers the last set of settings used- You don't have to reselect which computer you want it to go to. It chooses the last one used. AWESOME!!!!- The MX860 made you choose which computer you went to every single time you scanned- With 5 computers running at any given time in the house, but usually scanning to just one repeatedly (Win7 via VMWare on the iMac), it's been a godsend to be able to just walk up to the machine, press SCAN, and it scans to the right machine!Faxing:- Again, flawless...and FAST!!!- From a cold boot, the machine is ready to fax in about 15-20 seconds- From the machine booted, it's almost instant- Load the document feeder, press FAX, enter the number & press Black & White or Color and away it goes!- Love it!Wireless:- Rock solid! It's never left the network- My MX860 would sometimes disappear from the network & come back (wasn't for long, but it was annoying sometimes), this one NEVER leaves the network and if you have to reboot it, it finds the network FAST!!!- I'm using an Apple Airport Extreme routerCool Extras:- The Canon Software rocks!- If you get one, try the cool Canon Creative Park printable cutout animals- Very, very cool!- We printed out a bunny, cut it out, glued it together and the kids loved it!- Yeah, it's a gimmick to get you to use more ink, but still, VERY COOL!!!Overall:- I still love it, would recommend it to friends, and would buy another one!",4,"Great wireless scanner/printer, drinks ink",1343952000,"08 3, 2012",1154,507,517,0.98065764,helpful

First, there is a limit of 3 minutes per call on the answering machine.  You can change the default, but not above this (if they permit changing, why not to a higher number than 3 minutes??).  Second, the Caller ID performance is poor.  Sometimes you have to wait for 2 or more rings just to get the Caller ID info to show.  Not very helpful when you want to know whether or not to pick up before the answering machine.  On rare occasions, Caller ID information does not display at all.  Third, and this is the WORST, the battery is AWFUL.  It is recommended that you not re-charge until the battery gets completely low, but this is not practical.  The battery strength indicator has 3 bars, and if you wait until you get to the 3rd bar before recharging, you better hope you don't get a phone call because you'll only have 15 minutes before the phone begins beeping incessantly at you to let you know.  The beeps come in the form of periodic triple-beeps that interrupt your phone call...during the beeping you cannot hear the other party and they cannot hear you...it is extremely annoying and you have to wonder why it was made so.  Does Panasonic think that the only way you will know that the battery is low is if they constantly beat you over the head?  As a result your only choice is to NOT follow the recommendation.  And now after 6 weeks of normal use (less than normal, actually...I am in a 1-person household and don't use the phone much) I have a completely useless battery.  It will go from fully charged to completely dead in about 30 minutes, and takes forever to charge back up again.Bottom line: this phone has great features, but don't be fooled.

I decided to stray from the HP lineup and the Kodak ESP9 had all I was looking for:  Wired Network, Duplexing, and Scan/Fax capabilities.  I wasn't specifically looking for the 'cheap ink' option but what the heck - bonus.First off, I've burned through more ink in a few days than weeks with the old HP (5550) so there's no saving there - yeah, the cartridges may be cheaper but you require many more - so it's a wash.The scanner works ""sometimes"".  It will say ""scanning"" and simply sit there so it's 50/50 whether it will scan directly from the unit or using the software - never both reliably.As far as printing photos, I continually need to run ""clean print head"" and ""nozzle correction"" utilities to get a reasonable looking photo - otherwise, it's typically washed out in blue.  When it does work, the pictures look good.Updating firmware is a joke.  You can only update with USB cable and simply connecting it does not work.  You must disconnect and delete the printer from within Windows, reinstall drivers as USB printer, then cross your fingers.  After updating to the latest firmware, Kodak's Network Discovery service that allows you to connect via Ethernet no longer works (after several reboots) so still cannot re-connect the printer.Another fun feature is that having duplexing on while printing a photo (from the 4x6 photo tray even!), the printer complains that photo paper cannot be used for double-sided printing - I'm not trying to.  The photo fits on 1 page and it should not even be attempting to duplex.The fax seems to send and receive good - however that's not enough to warrant anything other than 1 start for this ""all in one"".I have been troubleshooting for some time now and am not writing to whine - just to warn others of these issues.Update 8/19/2008:Got the printer reconnected shortly after the above review.  I must, however, add how much ink this garbage eats up.  Referring back to a cheap HP 5550, I would print at the same volume and go MONTHS and MONTHS without ever needing to replace the print cartridge.

362960,APS7DSOM9REID,B0011UXSHK,"NoSleep2Nite4Me ""MCO""","[1384, 1414]","The key to using Magicjack without any problems is to research information on it first to decide whether it's right for you *and* whether it will work for you.  It's not really as easy as 1-2-3 nor will it work magically despite its name. You need to exceed its miminum system requirements, have high speed internet service (like cable), and YES, your PC has to be on with your internet connection available for Magicjack to work. But for $20 a year (initially cost is $39.95 for the Magicjack with 1 year phone service), to me, Magicjack is a great product which provides free unlimited long distance across the country and local phone service. However, Magicjack should not be your only phone service because if your electricity or internet connection goes out, Magicjack won't work.  At least also have use of a cell phone service.I bought my Magicjack from its website [...] and received it in less than a week after I ordered it. If you want the option of returning it easily should you decide not to use it, most people on the web recommend buying it from a store like Walmart, Radioshack, Best Buy or even QVC. It took me less than 10 minutes to install Magicjack (plug it into your PC's USB), register it, pick a phone number in my area and start using it. For me, deciding which number to use took the longest time.  I live basically in Philadelphia, PA so there were a lot of local numbers I could select. The [...] site lists its available area codes and phone prefixes. Not all areas are available yet so make sure you can select a local phone number for your needs before buying Magicjack.  Keep in mind that if you use a non-local phone number for your Magicjack, people that call you may incur toll charges or long distance charges.After Magicjack was up and running, I tested it by making calls to and receiving calls from landline phones, cell phones, Vonage phone service users and other Magicjack users. Everyone I called commented that they can hear me clearly. I also had no trouble hearing them just as well. No echoes, no static, no disconnections, no strange noises. The longest phone call I've made so far lasted about a little over an hour.Now, mind you, my Magicjack is on an IBM X41 laptop which has 1.49GB RAM, 1.50Ghz Pentium M processor and Windows XP (Professional) SP3. Magicjack is basically the only main application that is running on this computer. You do not need a dedicated PC for Magicjack but it won't work as well on a computer that have other large applications such as multi-media, graphic programs, email systems and games running at the same time. My internet connection is cable and I have a wireless router but the computer with Magicjack is connected ""wired"" to the router. I specifically wanted to test Magicjack on this type of system setup so that I couldn't blame any problems I might encounter on any other factor. I also wanted a system that I could leave running for 24 hours if I decided to use Magicjack as one of my main phone service.The one problem I did encounter was at the beginning when I found that one of my phones wouldn't ring when someone called me. By googling the problem, I found out that this problem is due to the ringer equivalency number (REN) of the phone you are using (google ""phone REN"" to find out what it is). Most phones have their REN listed at the bottom of the base unit. From my experience, I believe Magicjack will only work for phones that have REN of up to 1.0B (add up all phones in your system to get your total REN. Mine had a corded base with 0.6B REN with 2 more cordless handsets.  I figured that made my phone system total to 1.8B REN). Magicjack did ring on a phone that had 0.98B REN. To fix the problem, I bought a multi-handset GE DECT 6.0 (model 28223 Series) which basically has REN 0.0B. Magicjack had no problems ringing with this phone.  My phone system was over 3 years old anyway so I didn't mind replacing it.My system setup is probably an optimum environment for Magicjack although while Magicjack is running on one computer, I have another laptop running wirelessly connected to my cable modem in addition to a desktop connected wired to it also running *and* a Vonage modem connected to it.To find out if Magicjack is right for you, google reviews on it first and be sure to read up on the system requirements and recommendations from Magicjack users that have had no problems using Magicjack and love using it. These users will offer the most detailed information and they give out tips and tricks to make Magicjack work at its best such as how to set up your system for automatic reboot, optimize your internet connection, set up your USB ports so your computer doesn't power it off, using ""thin clients"", etc. Be aware that you'll also find a lot of reviews from people who hate Magicjack but most of them seemed to have bought Magicjack when it first came out. You'll find complaints about Magicjack's customer support also but since I've had no problems so far, I have no experience with them. I used Google to get the answer to all the questions I had about Magicjack.Personally, I think Magicjack works better than my Vonage whose service I plan to stop using soon.  Also, don't be afraid to try it out even if you're not technical.

It produces photo prints that are closest to those that you would get from store processing. It also does quite a good job with text. It merits its ""best buy"" status.But is any printer really a ""best buy"" for photo printing when compared to photo processing? To get store-quality prints with the 860 you need Canon's best paper. And when you use that paper the prints cost far more than store processed prints, but you get nothing more for your expense than immediacy. So, if you need an instant print perhaps it is worth the extra, but the additional cost of printing from the 860 versus taking your memory card to the local store could be immense if you take a lot of photos.In a couple of important respects the 860 prints you get even with Canon Photo Paper Pro are inferior to processed pics. If you bend the Pro paper you will not just get a crease in the paper, you will also get a pronounced line in the photo itself, and it doesn't take much of a bend to cause this. It is also very easy to scratch the surface of the prints. So, they are much more easily damaged than conventional photos. Also, the independent company that does the testing for print longevity has found that the Canon prints will only last about 25 years, while those of HP and Epson will last more than 75 years. Many people want pictures they can save for their grandchildren (or ""posterity""), and the Canon prints apparently won't meet that desire.Canon supples software that you need to utilize all print features. This consumes more time and reduces efficiency. (At least on a Mac.) Even using the printer tray, the pictures are not properly centered if you choose to have borders. There is more white space on some sides than others, so I consider that option useless.Most people rate this printer compared to other printers. I prefer to compare it to other real-world options. In that respect it only does so-so.

The gel pad has just the right amount of elevation and is soft and conformable so gives ever so slightly with wrist motion as you use the mouse (a good thing).

This pack (E-P100) is for the ES-series. For the CP-series, you needKP-108IN.The most cost-effective paper and ink pack for the Selphy ES-series, comes down to about 26 cents per photo right now. The box contains two 50-photo ink/paper packs. The ink and paper are in the same cartridge, which if you have seen the previous models, looks like a CP-style ink cartridge glued to its full paper tray.Everything you need to print exactly 100 postcard-back photos.The cartridges come with a small orange tab lock in place. You need to remove it before inserting into the printer as the instructions say. The cartridge won't go in all the way otherwise, so you can't damage the printer, but you risk having the ink film cut due to its tension and therefore the entire 50-pack ruined. Don't ask me how I know.These dye-sub packs print exactly the number of photos indicated, no more, no less, no matter the color coverage on the photo. The ""ink"" cartridge has a roll of 4-inch-wide film with 6-inch-long sections of each dye (yellow, magenta, cyan) followed by a clear coat, repeated exactly 36 times.When printing, each dye layer goes over the photo and transfers the color to the paper using heat. Sublimation is vaporizing the ""ink"" from the film in controlled amounts, which is then deposited onto the paper. The printer lets you see the photo at each stage which is neat. The final layer is a plastic clear coat that makes it smudge-proof and water-resistant.The result of this process is that the film inside the used ink cartridge ends up with a pretty accurate ""ghost"" of the picture left in each color layer. That is why the cartridge can't be reused, but that also means the photos you printed can be recovered from a discarded ""empty"" cartridge. If that is a problem then I suppose you can yank the film out and dispose of it some other way (not heat as it may cause the remaining dye to vaporize in the air you breathe).",5,the ink/paper kit to buy for the ES-series Selphy printers,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",359,40,40,1,helpful

Believe it or not, I *just* finished up the starter cartridge-- true, I don't print that much, but I would say I printed a few hundred pages at least.  No regrets at all.  This shows really well for Brother.][UPDATE: I've had the printer now for about three months and it's exactly what I wanted.  Not only that, but I'm using the ink-saver setting and am still on the starter cartridge that came with the printer!  As expected, there are now after-market printer ink refill options.  People were just being whiney.  All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase.]I too was frustrated to see so few reviews of this product as I was deciding whether to purchase it (there was only one yesterday!).  So, here's my initial review based on having used the printer for less than 24 hours.  I'll adjust if my later experience changes.First, the basics: the printer fundamentally does what it says it does.  It prints laser quality copies off at a remarkable speed (at least for someone used to an inkjet printer).  Nobody expects the performance listed on the box, I think, but just to give you an idea I tried printing a 19 page PDF document.  It printed in about 90 seconds: 15 seconds to warm up and process, and another 68 seconds to print the document.  That comes to something like 17 pgs per minute-- not the 34 ppm on the box, but really, who cares?As per the noise issue: yes, I notice the fan, but it's not as bad as everyone makes it sound.  I don't really think it makes a difference while I'm printing... afterwards, though, you do kinda wish it would shut off.  It's not a half hour like someone said-- it's more like 5-10 minutes, but maybe still too much.  I couldn't find a way to change the fan settings but it is something that could be fixed in software.As for the printer refills, yes-- it seems there are not yet aftermarket refills.  However this is unlikely to stay this way; one place told me to check back in a month.  I can wait a month, or pay for one Brother refill.SO FAR-- not a bad purchase for a Black Friday sale, not bad at all.",4,Definitely positive review,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",389,56,57,0.98245614,helpful

This product obviously was either ineptly designed, or it was designed to become dysfunctional within a short period of time.I did come to the Amazon.com to glance at the reviews, but I foolishly let myself be persuaded by the review(s) that had 5-stars and claimed not to be written by Epson employees (or stock holders?), because I wanted to believe that I was going to obtain a good unit, although it was manufactured among a group of lemons. I minimized the insights provided by those who would prefer to throw the unit through the plate glass windows at Epson's corporate headquarters, because I knew that I would not be investing a lot of money in a used / returned item that had polarized so many customers.  It seems like all you get when you buy one of these products is a trigger that will send you to your shrink for psychotherapy.I'd like the thank all those customers who shared their experience with the clogged head problem, because their collective experience has convinced me that it would be a waste of time for me to spend time and money trying to fix a problem on my particular machine, when it is most likely that my machine suffers from the same design flaw as theirs and is therefore not worth the bother.Since the printer head eventually becomes non-operational and virtually useless, don't buy this item under the delusion that you will get an ""all-in-one"" printer/copier/scanner: odds are, you will only get a USB scanner. For the $40 I paid in the eBay auction, I guess I will choose to be happy that I got a pretty good scanner at a low price.===============================================================UPDATE, 1/2/2006. I wish I would have taken my own advice a few weeks ago and had just accepted that the Epson CX5400 is a dysfunctionally designed machine and let it go at that. But, no, I had to see if I could ""rescue"" it, so I did a little research on the Internet, and I turned saving it into a ""project."" I soon discovered what the nature of problem is. I wish I hadn't, though, because I would have spared myself a lot of time, trouble, and additional expense if I had just walked away.  But I allowed myself to get sucked into the challenge anyway, so I will now share what I learned for the wise and wary.For anyone inclined to waste a lot of time trying to rescue their own Epson CX5400, I refer you to a web site called fixyourownprinter.com. There where you will learn in a forum devoted to the problems of this all-in-one printer-copier-scanner ([...])  that the reason this printer just stops printing at some point most likely has to do with the fact that an ink discharge tube, which is inconveniently located in a very hard-to-reach place underneath the carriage that contains the ink cartridges, got disconnected from the plastic tip it must be attached to. It seems that the pressure caused by the charging system when ink cartridges are replaced can blow that tube right off its mooring. Since no ink can flow, no printing can occur. The problem is a design flaw created by Epson's engineers, and that is why so many hundreds of people who bought that machine are justifiably upset with Epson for putting that turkey on the market.For those with a lot of time on their tiny hands, as well as the dexterity and patience of a heart surgeon, there is some good technical advice in the forum about how to access that tiny, space with long, curved, needle-nosed pliers so that you can re-attach the tube to get the ink flowing again. After many frustrating hours, I did manage to succeed in doing that.But I really do not recommend that anyone not condemned to three consecutive life terms waste your time in trying to resurrect this machine, because, in addition to the tube disconnect problem, this machine seems to suffer from interminably clogged printing heads that do not deliver a photo worth looking at. After I re-connected the dangling tube, I cleaned the heads dozens of times and ran the nozzle check just as often, and, after three weeks of tests, I have yet to get a nozzle print out that is satisfactory. All the colors have gaps and broken lines. On top of all that, it is expensive to run those print head tests, since this machine guzzles ink faster than an SUV sucks gas while driving through the desert with the air conditioner going full blast.I even went on eBay, where I bought some EKS Print Head Cleaning Solution from a guy who specializes in printer repair. I used it several times over a period of two weeks to clean those heads, and while I think the cleaning solution may be a good product, I still did not get to a point where I get a satisfactory nozzle check print out. Nor do I get good quality prints of text documents or of color photos. Using the same Photoshop image, I compared the highest quality color photo print the Epson CX5400 could deliver with what my Canon i450 could do, and the Canon i450 far out-performed my CX5400. The Canon delivered a sharp, crisp, highly detailed, well resolved image with saturated colors. In contrast, the Epson presented with a softer image that not only lacked snap and contrast, but it did not even the colors right!So, while I am happy for those who say that they are happy with the CX5400 machine that they bought, I cannot include myself in that group, nor do I ever expect to in regards to the particular hardware I acquired cheaply on eBay. I will still get some use out of it as a USB scanner and possibly a low priority copier -- at least until the ink runs out.

I chose not to get a replacement printer for the following reasons:1) Printer was much more difficult to set up than previous Canon and HP printers I have owned.2) Printer has so many moving parts that appeared to be cheaply made and most likely break after minimal usage.3) Access to the print head and ink cartridges is very awkward because the top only lifts about half way.4) Printer made so many clanking and grinding noises that it sounded like it wouldn't last a long time. These sounds may have been due to the printer being defective but; I wouldn't want to take that chance.5) The fact that the printer was defective I think is indicative to the complexity and poor quality of this model.I plan on getting a single purpose photo printer and continue to use separate film/slide and document scanners.,1,Printer is clunky and complicated,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",222,12,30,0.4,not helpful

I really wanted something to do it all. It had to do decent faxing, plus serve my needs for scanning and copying as well. I already have a high-end photo printer, so basic printing was fine for me.This did all I hoped for and then some. The Fax worked great, I hooked it up to my home phone system and it does a great job of detecting voice versus fax calls and switching them appropriately. You'll hear the answering machine pick up for a second when sending a fax to it, but that's a very minor nit. Quality of the fax is nice. I did notice that it only redials 3 times on a busy signal, but I hope to find a function to set that higher. The document feeder is essential, you'll find a lot of multifunctions do not include one and you have to load the pages one at a time. It also has a nice cover for the paper feeder in the back, a nice feature if you do not print a lot.Scanning is considerably slower than my old flatbed to get high quality but the results look good. Anything less than high quality is not that great, but fine for anything but photos.The printing quality is not quite as good as my dedicated photo printer, but I doubt most home office users would notice. You'll still get very decent photos and color printing out of this, certainly far better than most multifunctions. It's good enough that if I did not already have a high end color injet, I probably would be fine with this one.Overall, I'm very pleased with this printer and recommend it highly.Followup - I had some issues with the FAX detection on this machine that weren't too obvious immediately. I'd be talking to someone when all of a sudden, the line would just cut out. We finally figured out that the fax was cutting in for some reason. It seemed to be getting worse, so I started playing with the settings and finally switched over to using the distinctive ring feature. This is a cool option where you pay the phone company a few extra dollars a month and they give you a separate phone number that comes over the same line but with a different ring. Mine for instance does 2 short rings in a row. You can then set the Fax machine to recognize that tone and pick up. So I know have my own Fax number without paying for another line, I know when it's a Fax coming through due to the ring, and I have *almost* no problems with the machine cutting into my calls. It still does it if I'm on the phone a long time, but it's very infrequent at least, and not a big enough issue for me to be concerned with. It does however sometimes have problems getting the fax. I had a client in Germany try several times and could not get it to come through. Not sure if that's an issue with the machine though, or just my old phone lines. Also, the scan quality at the highest level is pretty good...but also very, very slow. So don't expect to be scanning lots of photos in a short amount of time.  Due to these issues, I'd probably go with just 4 stars, but it's still an excellent machine.",5,The best multifunction out there!,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",576,20,21,0.952380952,helpful

868258,A1Z2G0MN861KSU,B004QM99K0,EBOB,"[276, 282]","WHY I BOUGHT IT: I've had this printer for only two days but here are my initial reactions: I can't compare this machine with other 3-in-1's.  I come from having three separate units to handle print, fax, and scan, so the 3-in-1 (four with copy) is a pleasure both for functionality and space saving.  I've been a pretty loyal HP user, but I switched to this Brother this time because of the comparatively high reader scores on Amazon, because Consumer Reports gave it good grades, because ink costs are relatively low compared to many others especially inkjets, because I don't expect to give it heavy use and the laser toner will not dry up over time.  For color and photos I still retain my old excellent HP photo printer, or I can head to the Copymat store, so I didn't see the need for color on this one.SETUP: Setup on the home network was fairly easy.  Wired hookup to the main computer was basically plug and play, but getting the networked computer to recognize the new printer took some detective work. Ultimately I had to search through the on-disk documentation (as opposed to the printed User's Guide) to figure it out.  I knew I had to set the printer driver on the ""share"" position in Windows, but I learned that I also had to change the network setting on the printer itself, via the printer's menu.  Had this been explicit in either the Start Here or User's Guide (maybe it's there, but I didn't see it), I would have been saved some frustration.USING IT: The fax worked right away even though I do not have a dedicated fax line and my only line is hooked to an answering machine - a common situation I imagine. The explicit directions on how to deal with the answering machine question made it a no-brainer.  The fax machine now recognizes a fax tone coming in, but otherwise lets the answering machine take the call.Use is intuitive and straightforward in all functions.  The Control Center is basic enough to dig right in for quick use without having to slog through the User's Guide for most operations.  The smart scanning software has basic use at the front but has advanced controls should you need them. The Control Center software is much more user-friendly than the scanning software I was using for my Epson scanner.  As indicated in other reviews, the LCD screen is absurdly small and not nearly bright enough to see easily, even at the highest contrast setting, but once setup is completed, I suspect there is infrequent need to refer to it.I wouldn't recommend the machine if you need batch printing of envelopes.  The manual paper feeder accepts only one envelope or sheet of labels at a time, and to avoid crinkled copies one must open up the back - an inconvenient step depending on the position of the printer. Feeding one envelope without opening up the back sends the envelope through the main print loop and produces an envelope with some creases but suitable for casual, not business, use.  For this reason alone, I gave the rating 4 stars as opposed to 5, since occasionally it would be convenient to print more than one envelope or label page at a time.The fan noise others have complained about does not bother me.  I hear it, but it is not loud or annoying to me, and only lasts for several minutes before it goes into a ""deep sleep"" (no snoring observed yet).SUMMARY: Overall, this is a very nice machine. It does what it says, quickly, quietly, efficiently. It prints crisp, clean text as one expects of laser printers, and cranks out about 20 ppm. Scanning docs including color photos are amazingly clear and true.  I recommend this unit.  If I have further comments after I give it more use, I'll update.UPDATE (12/19/11): Now that I've used the machine for a little over a month, I can say I find it a pleasure to use for all functions.  While I can't figure out a way to print more than one envelope or label sheet at a time and they must be fed manually, the trick to printing wrinkle-free is to read the manual (duh), which instructs you not only to open the back but to adjust two green levers down.  Once that adjustment is made, envelopes slide through with nary a wrinkle.  I know, reading the manual isn't much fun, but once in awhile you learn something. With that caveat, I'm bumping my review to a full five star.",5,Meets its promise,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",763,276,282,0.978723404,helpful

101291,AU7G5X7X06HY7,B0000A995A,Matthew R. Holiday II,"[22, 29]","Executive summary: the scanner has good and bad points.The immediate problem is that the drivers available as of 9/2003 do not support Apple's new USB2.0-based Macs (G5, new iMac). Canon acknowledges the problem and says they're working on new drivers, but no promise on when they'll be delivered. Another, less obvious downside is that the current generation driver leaves a background process running whether or not the scanner is plugged in, which process prevents the computer from going into &quot;sleep mode&quot; on its own (OSX 10.2). Also, I noticed that when I linked the scan button to PS Elements, it started Elements in classic mode (solution: link to files Preview, or scan from within Elements). Again, as others have noticed, it can be slow and noisy. I do believe that when it works with USB2.0 Macs, it will be faster; currently, some scans finish (in the scanner) while data remains to be transferred to the host. Lastly, the OCR software still runs only in classic mode.So, what are the good points? For one, price. For another, its form factor, including the fact that it's USB-bus powered (even with a PowerBook) -- no wall wart or line lump required. With the driver installed, you don't have to start the &quot;Canon toolbox&quot; program to use the keys on the front of the scanner, and once you've configured the software, there's no delay to click buttons on-screen to make the scanner scan (for example, to copy). Four buttons are nice, too. Less obviously, its origin for scanning is at the front left of the scanner, rather than the back; if you need to scan a bunch of cards or 4x6 photos, it's more ergonomic. I haven't tried the &quot;Z-fold&quot; lid trick yet with books. I haven't used it enough to judge its quality with color photos, but scanning index cards in black&amp;white or grayscale, or using it as a black&amp;white copier, it seems fine.I think the scanner is a keeper, but then, my requirements are for a simple flat-bed scanner, and not for a graphics powerhouse model.

It maybe took 30 seconds (didn't really time it) to scan 5 pages directly into Acrobat with a full OCR scan.  My unscientific test tells me it meets spec.  I remember back when Acrobat 3 came out, and I spent big bucks to buy a Dual Pentium Pro which was the fastest PC you could build ourself back then.  Scanning took minutes per page and OCR was so slow you could watch as it moved down the page.I think I probably paid too much for the ""Deluxe"".  I was in a hurry and didn't realize there was cheaper version for 30 bucks less.  I haven't used the Windows Rack2-Filer yet, but it just looks gimmicky.

I had bought it with a lot of trepidation and very low expectations, because I had read some negative reviews and thought that it would probably prove barely adequate for the job that I needed to do ... digitize literally hundreds of up-to 50-year-old color slides and color and black-and-white negatives for posterity. I had already bought a highly-rated CanoScan 9000 photo scanner to handle the color and black-and white prints I want to convert. But I needed something a lot faster for the boxes and boxes of color slides and negative film that I had accumulated over these many years. Well, I couldn't believe the initial results! I should add that I am a relatively experienced photographer and quite computer- and electronic gadget-savvy. So, that may explain why I was able to use this converter right out-of-the-box, without any difficulty or pain whatsoever. The few controls are intuitive, and the scanning speed is amazing. I digitized an initial two boxes of 35-mm color slides in just a few minutes. But the results are what constituted the most pleasant surprise. Obviously, if the original slide is of poor quality, the scanned, digitized image will still be poor. But I found that a good slide will produce a digital image of at least equal quality. That is a lot more than I expected at the price I paid for this gadget! The beauty of it is that once the images are digitized, I am able to make further enhancements using my Photoshop software. In short, this thing can't be beat at this price! It exceeds all my expectations in terms of speed, simplicity, ease of use, and above all, image quality.

Lower price here from seller other than amazon, but shipping so exorbitant, it was less expensive to buy locally.Set up went well. Instructions were decipherable. The unit seems sturdy enough. It's quite large, taking up more desk width than its stated dimensions. The suspension mechanism causes it to need almost 34 inches side to side. The exterior width of the drawer itself is 28 inches. The interior width of the well of the tray, where the keyboard and mouse lie, is 25 1/2 inches. The well's depth is 10 inches.My microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard fits easily into the width of the drawer and there's plenty of space for the mouse. My ergo keyboard depth is a bit long for the interior well of the drawer. The ergo keyboard's depth is 10 1/2 inches at its deepest. This was easily worked around, by placing a foam wrist rest under the far edge of the ergo keyboard, another under the close edge. I'm finding that when I'm typing, I pull the ergo keyboard a bit closer to me, so that its close edge is lying upon the foam wrist rest of the Fellowes drawer, all the way at its nearest edge.The built in mouse pad is okay. It's fine for my apple optical mouse. The width and depth of the mouse area is larger than the tray of the keyboard drawer that this Fellowes drawer replaces. And I don't have to reach lower for the mouse as its on the same level as the keyboard.So I think this keyboard drawer is a pretty good product. I can live with its extra wide dimension, as I didn't need to be filling screw holes and drilling new holes in the underside of my computer desk.

609502,ASH4COAK80Q73,B002O3W4LE,Ashok Aiyar,"[1110, 1156]","We purchased an Ooma Hub & Scout in April 2009 to replace a Vonage VoIP connection. We are very satisfied with the hub, and therefore purchased an Ooma Telo for a second location.  This review describes our Ooma Telo experience so far, and compares it to the Hub/Scout.The Telo is well designed and sleek. The controls are touch controls and very sensitive. There is a USB port in the back - presumably for future expansion.  Like the hub, there are two RJ45 ethernet jacks - one to connect to the ""internet"", and the second to connect to one's home network.  There are also two RJ11 phone jacks.  One to connect to your existing landline, should you have one, and decide to integrate the landline and Telo.  The other is to connect to your phone.The setup instructions are simple.  While it is recommended that the Telo be connected directly to your cable/dsl/wimax modem (i.e. before your router), it works equally well after the router. We chose to connect the Telo to the router rather than the modem.We were treated to a red & blue patriotic light show for about 20 minutes when the Telo was first plugged in, while it apparently downloaded firmware/software updates.  I was a little puzzled by this, but presumably there have been updates from the release date (October 1) to our purchase date (October 3), or the first set of units were shipped without the latest firmware/software on them.  In either event, there has been a second firmware/software update since then, so clearly Ooma are keen to improve Telo as feedback/complaints from early adopters rolls in.Unlike the Hub, the Telo doesn't support the Scout. But this doesn't mean the Telo cannot provide a dial tone at other phone jacks in your house.  For this, simply connect a splitter to the phone jack in the Telo, plug one line into the telephone adjacent to the Telo, and the second into the nearest wall jack.  If the phone wiring in your house is intact, you should be able to connect a standard wired phone to any other phone jack. The Ooma Hub also supports this feature, which isn't readily documented in Ooma's product literature.The Telo and Hub are indistinguishable in every aspect of call quality.  Off course the Telo supports up to four DECT 6.0 handsets, and Telo to Telo calls will offer HD voice.  The Telo will also support Bluetooth, and cell-phone integration.  Although these features will be available in future firmware/software updates.There are differences in the level and cost of service that I have described below.For current Ooma Hub owners:Ooma Core includes 5000 minutes a month, voicemail and caller-id and is free of regulatory fees for the life of the hub.Ooma Premiere includes a range of additional features, including a second line, 3-way calling, multi-ring, call fowarding and many others.  This costs $9.99 a month or $99 a year.For future Ooma Hub owners:Ooma Core will include 5000 minutes a month and voicemail. From the second year, it will cost $12/yr to recover regulatory fees.Ooma Premiere will include enhanced voicemail, and the other premiere features.  Ooma Premiere will cost $9.99 a month or $120 a year.For Ooma Telo:Ooma core includes 5000 mins/month & voicemail, and $12/yr from the second year on to recover regulatory fees.Ooma Premiere will include enhanced voicemail, and the other premiere features at $9.99 a month or $120 a year.For both the Hub and Telo, the cost of Premiere includes either a free handset a year (a $49 value), or a free number port (a $39 value).This change in pricing strategy has made some claim that Ooma is no longer ""free"".Well, it never was, although current Hub owners will not have to spend another dime for the life of their unit.New Hub & Telo users receive 5000 mins/month and voicemail for the cost of the unit, and have to pay $12/year from the second year onwards to cover regulatory fees.In my opinion Ooma continues to remain a good value when compared to other VoIP providers, although clearly early Hub adopters received a better deal than Telo users.I want to note two other things that are common to the Hub and Telo. Our number ports were quick and efficient.  And, while customer service can be difficult to reach, there is excellent support available from the Ooma community on Ooma's website forums.  The Ooma employees who moderate the forums also provide support in a very timely manner.Bottom-line, if you have Vonage or Packet8, or have phone bundled in with your cable, strongly consider getting a Telo.  You will save money for service that is as good or better. With the Hub, we saw savings with the first six months.  With the Telo it will be about 14 months before we start seeing savings.Quick summary - highly recommended!",5,"Excellent design, service and value",1255564800,"10 15, 2009",800,1110,1156,0.960207612,helpful

The keypad numbers are sealed, but the buttons themselves are very small.If this is really a shop phone, then why isn't there some sort of bright flashing light that lets you know visually when a call is coming in?

I'm sure that the &quot;spare&quot; battery won't last any longer than the one you leave permanently attached to the phone.One supposed selling point for this phone is that you can put in a garage or shop where you have no phone line installed. You can do this because it comes with a transmitter/receiver unit that you can plug in anywhere in the house there's a phone jack. Don't try to use this phone very far from the trans./receiver unit because its range is pretty low.I'm giving this phone only one star because it has some useless features, is missing several other necessary features, costs too much for what you get, and doesn't perform very well, ESPECIALLY considering it's billed as a specialized shop phone.",1,Not loud enough for a shop phone,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",271,15,16,0.9375,helpful

We were paying Frontier around $41 for the land phone, with the very same options. That's quite a savings..When you sign up for Basic Talk, you can request to have your phone number transferred to the new service. This takes up to 10 days.. Our's took less than a week. BasicTalk told me NOT to contact my phone company to cancel my service because they wouldn't be able to transfer my number, but once the transfer was complete, the phone company would cancel our phone service.. Simple, and yes, it does work.. The problem is, once Frontier received the transfer info, they also cancelled our wireless internet service... Without the internet, no BasicTalk phone service..I had to call Frontier early this morning to get it straightened out.. They said our phone and wireless service were bundled, so once we switched phone service, they cancelled the wireless service, too..No one warned us about this! It never even occurred to me that this was a possibility.. It has been an entire day of nothing but stress and frustration, getting different information from everyone I talked to at Frontier.. I was told it would be fixed today, then told it'd be next Wednesday before we had internet service again, then told it would take 24 hours, then I was told it would be Monday, then told again it would be Wednesday...... After getting very pissy with the last person I spoke to (the last of five customer service reps), suddenly, we have service again...So, do yourself a favor.. If your wireless internet service and present phone number are with the same company, make sure they aren't bundled before you sign up for BasicTalk.. If they are, get them unbundled before going any further.. It will be easy peasy if you make sure the services are seperated..",5,"it works, but you don't need to buy this device..Also, make sure your present service isn't bundled.",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",438,41,43,0.953488372,helpful

For full blown document management, it's going to disappoint.After seeing a lot of negative/luke warm reviews, I delayed buying this thing, but I'm glad I finally did.I have a full sized scanner with a document feed for scanning and storage of documents like bank statements, meeting notes, etc.  This scanner is a little too slow for that since it has to be fed one paper at a time.But for those times when I'm on the road and need to send someone a copy of something, I can scan it in and email it rather than hunting down a fax machine.  Or scan it, throw the paper away and not carry huge stacks of paper for the trip back.For receipts, it works great.  The OCR isn't fool proof, but there's so much information on the average receipt, that it does a pretty good job.  It seems to learn a bit, so that I had to enter the info on a Hertz receipt the first time (tons of information on those) and then afterwards it knows it is a Hertz receipt and even pulls the correct tax and total now.  It still pulls the rental start date rather than end date as the receipt date however.  For gas station receipts, they often say ""Welcome to ___ Shell"" and after the first time I entered the info, it now knows that it is a shell receipt.Receipts can be fed any direction and the program will try to figure out which way is up.  Seems to work best if fed top first, but with jagged edges, sideways works just fine.My old way of doing expense reports was going through the stack of receipts, grouping them to the right time period and project and flat bed scanning them.  Now I just enter them one at a time, no need to worry about order or grouping as long as I enter the receipt date and project.  Then just highlight the right ones, and it'll create a nice .pdf with a summary of the amounts as the first sheet and pictures of the receipts fit as best as possible on the following pages.Business card scanning works pretty well.  Takes some editing to fix entries, but given how varied business card formats are, it guesses fairly well on what's the company name, what's the phone number, cell number, email address etc.  It keeps the picture of the card so if there is a typo in the email or phone number, I'm not completely stuck, I can pull that up.One annoying thing is the software license allows installing on only one computer.  And they don't sell a license for just the software so to be legal, you'd have to buy 2 scanners to use on say a home PC and a laptop.  There is a way to install just the scanner drivers so it can be used with multiple machines.

234032,A3JUHP1E3WUHEA,B000GTPRPS,Dr. Stuart Gitlow,"[314, 325]","It's 10/5/06 and I'm editing this review right up front with the first paragraph, because this little calc has a problem that I hadn't noticed initially. The new HP keys, as I describe below, are great. They have a solid click and a good rollover ability - meaning that you can push the number 1, then push the number 2 before letting go of the 1 entirely, and you'll still get ""12"" on the screen. That's perfect. Here's the downside: Rapidly enter the number ""1100."" Click-click-click-click. And yet my screen says ""10."" Why? Because a rapid double-click of a numeric key results in the calculator noticing only the first click. If a typewriter worked that way, I'd be attending metings every day instead of meetings.**UPDATE - 10/14/06** One of the commands available, not documented in the 50g material, but documented for several earlier HP calculators, is a KEYTIME command. Quite simply, replacing the default keytime with ""500"" eliminates missed keystrokes. This corrects the problem I described above.And now back to my original review:First, the keypad issue has been addressed with this model, and each key has a feel that is similar to the HP41 - just about perfect for data entry without needing to look at the keypad. Now all that's necessary is for HP to return to the complex keys that allowed for print both on the top surface and the beveled edge; that would allow for some improvement in the user interface. But overall this is a major step forward from the HP49 line.Next, the display is bright and legible with good contrast. These multiline displays still aren't quite as good as the single line displays from years past in terms of visibility at odd angles but we're coming close. There's plenty of information here with a seven line stack in the default mode.The manual is where the calculator loses a star. While the new manual is an improvement over the HP48/49 series (though it has less information, it is more understandable), it is nowhere near as complete and useful as the HP41 series manuals were. HP needs to bring back a well-written manual series with use of color, high-end paper, and quality typesetting. For example, the calculator comes with a user's manual; on page 1-20, it says that additional references can be found in Chapter 1 and Appendix C of the calculator's user's guide. What user's guide? They don't mean the manual since that doesn't have any Appendices (or an index, for that matter). Where would I get the user's guide? Then I discover that it is included, and is on the CD-ROM in pdf form. Apparently it is a larger version of the user's manual, with additional information, including an index. Much of the information in the Guide is duplicated from the Manual - but we still don't have complete programming and functional command discussion. Don't get me wrong - everything you need for standard operations is here; but if you really want to get into the capabilities of the calculator (and that's why you're spending $129, right?), we want the full manual. Oh, and bring back the manuals that are spiral-bound so we don't have to weigh the book down with something each time we turn to the calculator to try something.Here too is a connectivity kit of software, none of which runs on my Mac. I tried plugging it in to the Mac using the standard USB connecting cable (included) but nothing happened. Since I didn't buy the HP with any need to hook it up to my Mac, it's not a problem, but what good is connectivity if noone bothered with the Mac software?There are a few little nits that still need to be picked. For example, the stack is right justified but data entry is left justified. It is much easier to quickly review an entered number and compare it to numbers on the stack if they are similarly justified. The enter key needs to return to double-width just above the numeric portion of the keypad, and HP should finally pick a standard numeric/operator layout and stick with it. The HP41 had the major operators on the left. The HP48 put them on the right and changed the sequence. The HP50 keeps them on the right but bumped them all up by one key. For those of us who essentially touch-type on calculators, this relearning is a pain.I must admit that if HP simply rebuilt the HP41C series with more memory, they'd have a clear winner. And given the prices that those models sell for on eBay in new condition, HP could clearly do well with such a product.The connectivity issue would have cost another star, but the overall build quality, computing capabilities, programming capabilities, and incorporation of RPN on the 50g make it clearly worth 4 stars.",4,Significant improvement but...,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",806,314,325,0.966153846,helpful

I will note that I stopped using this as it is lousy. Hard to find toner. Apparently, nobody likes this for a variety of reasons.So I now see the full value of a USB port and a memory card slot (which this has neither. I have downgraded it to 2 stars, as my Epson Workforce 7510 is hands down a better machine in every way except text printing. I leave the original review below. I just do not see the value here, and my level of frustration has increased since setting it up. I wonder if color would have made a difference?? Probably not.Zero stars for the description, but this is clearly an error and should be noted. I can only hope that Amazon changes its description. With that said, it is a decent all-in-one office printer. Keep in mind that the stats for this say that it comes with an ink cartridge that is rated for 1000 pages and a standard cartridge is rated at 3500 pages. Images are sharp and crisp (but not like my Epson Workforce). Paper size is up to 8.5x14 inches. Printing is fast, and start up takes about 30 seconds when you first turn it on. This is one heavy printer (38.6 pounds) folks, so make sure you have a good sturdy place for it. It also has a medium to largish foot print, not as large as the old Brother we had in my office, but larger than my Epson Workforce that I have at home.....It is about the size of an older HP laserjet (but does so much more). It holds 250 sheets in the main tray, which is plenty for us. Power consumption is 800w, HOWEVER, this is an energy star printed and the stats say that it is energy star rated at 4.7w! That is great and will not be sucking energy all the time. It wakes up quickly enough, and you can set the time for how long before it sleeps.As for color, this does scan color, but it does NOT print color. Only black and white. Photographs do not print well on photo paper and if you just place one piece of photo paper over the regular paper it will pull up a sheet of plain paper with it and ruin the print, picking it up slightly after. If a printer can give me great B&W; prints these days, it should be used as an anchor....if it wasn't for the other qualities, I would say, ""printer overboard!""

I have used a lot of pens i don't like, so when i find one i like it's my baby.Pros:-The ink lasts a long time.  I got a dual pack for Christmas 2011 and use them interchangeably.  I'm just to the point where the ink is about out.  So for me one cartridge lasts about 6-8 months.-Refills are easy to find.  This pen is sold in most major stores, so if you need an emergency refill, you don't need to pay big $$$ for shipping.-The pen is durable.  I go out industrial environments all the time.  This pen has been banged against a lot of steel and doesn't really have dings to speak of.-The cartridges flow well and don't jam up.  Some other pens i've had work well for a while, then the ink stops flowing well even though it's clearly half full.  I've had 0 problems with that for these pens.-The clip is well built.  I like to snap the clip often.  It's my OCD habit when i'm thinking.  Plastic pens and even some metal ones will eventually break off from fatigue.  This one has been fine, and shows no signs of getting worse.-The grip is comfortable.  It's plastic, not rubber, which i actually like.  Rubber ones tend to absorb skin oils and get gross over time.  Plastic does not.  And it's contoured, so sweaty hands don't slip.-The pen comes apart easily.  Doesn't take vise grips.  Just screws apart.-Gives a satisfying click when you depress the plunger.Cons:-The printing comes off after a while.  Where it used to say ZEBRA F-301, it now says ZEB 01.  Not a big deal, but it's really the only thing i could find fault with.Update 3/7/14: Found two more slight faults.1) When used in extreme heat, the cartridge can explode.  I did some work in a hot room with this pen (roughly 120F).  The pen was in my pocket and it exploded.  The pen body kept the ink from getting on my pants, but i had to throw it out.  Sad day.  Not deducting any starts for that.2) The metal cap on the business end is most definitely not steel.  It's some other material with a shiny finish.  After a year and a half of heavy use, it's starting to come off a little.  What was once shiny and steel-looking is now dull and has a slight orange hue.  Again, i'm not deducting any stars because for the price i would expect something like this.  The pen still writes great and overall looks good.I also feel that it's worth noting that after 1.5 years the clip is still firmly in place and none of the screwed fittings have stripped out.  Like i said i like to snap and bend the clip a lot, and you can't tell i do that whatsoever.  I also take the pen apart a lot when i'm just keeping my hands busy.

So if color isn't that important to you, photos are fine.One nice aspect is the small footprint compared to other MFPs, which was a priority for me. Be aware that the 'starter' ink cartridges that come with this model won't last long -- mine gave out after only a couple of weeks of low-volume printing.

There are several spots for configuration, and functions like Combinations, Permutations, and Absolute value are not easily accessible. It often takes 3 or 4 selections to get to the menu you are looking for, and quit/exit/clear all do separate functions (even if that function is nothing). This does not handle differential equations or 3D functions either. There are dedicated buttons for converting mixed numbers and other such useless functions. Matrices are equally annoying and often take 10 times the work compared to a TI.examples are:a) Trying to evaluate Sum(abs(3-int(x/4))*16Cx,x,0,16) is an exercise is frustration.b) Evaluating det(A^-1*B + C) is even worse.etc..2) Graphing: Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I will say it has a brilliant screen/vivid screen and handles color graphing quite well. Speaking of graphing, it has the ability to concurrently graph Y(x), X(y) and Parametric functions.

We have 4 Plantronics headsets- 3 CS50s and a CS55. Our office staff all use these headsets so that they can move about and answer calls without being tied to the counter. The range is phenomenal- I, in particular often need to go outside to our production area and to the yard, and even when I'm over 200 feet away from the base unit with several concrete and steel walls in between, the sound quality is great. These units also seem to stand up well to abuse- I often use mine while diagnosing vehicle problems and while repairing equipment, and it's gotten grease on it, gotten wet, been dropped, gets used in very cold and hot environments, and is generally mishandled, yet it continues to work flawlessly. My only complaint about it is the over- the- ear clips. they are very uncomfortable for the first few weeks of use. After that, they do seem to mold to your ear, and the discomfort eventually goes away. Also, the handset lifter can be a little bit difficult to adjust just right, and we ended up having the tape the bottom of the handsets to the phone so that they'd release properly.

You can identify the new pens by looking at the eraser, if it is the same color as the pen - you are in luck and snatch it up ASAP - if it is white, save yourself the frustration and put the box back on the shelf, then go search out the Pilot FriXion.To be honest, I think the FriXion is the best erasable pen I've ever used. The larger size (.07 - still is fine) writes better than the super fine, but the eraser (it is rubber - not a traditional eraser) does not rip or smudge the page and hours later will still remove every trace of writing, in this regard it is far superior to any other erasable pen I've ever used (which seems to permanently set after a few hours).The only drawback with the FiXion is that because it uses thermal technology - the ink erases if you leave it in the sun or near a heat source.

Please do not get deceived like I did.I shopped with this seller twice, bought the exact same item twice. First, directly, second time, through Amazon.When I shopped through Amazon, they sent me the wrong item and they did not answer my calls at all, never returned my message that I left (via phone)I e-mailed them as well, and they did not answer my e-mails either. However, when I said that I will leave a negative feedback 'through' Amazon, they finally responded for the very first time. I also had an engraving issue with my first purchase and I even said that I will pay for the engraving to be redone, but they said that the pen was ""discontinued"" so there was nothing they could do, so I said I would like to purchase the nib and a cap separately and have the engraving redone, and I was happy to pay for the cost, but again, they said that they could not do it because the caps and the nibs are not sold separately. However, I checked with Waterman and they said that the exact same pens are still being made, in fact they told me that the pen I purchased was one of the newest items. In addition, Waterman sell nibs and caps separately as well. This seller said that caps and nibs are not sold separately so they lied about this as well. After all the lying and ignoring my messages etc, I feel like they made a mistake on purpose because the wrong item I received turned out to be the least popular item in the market. Maybe they had hard time selling it so they sent it to me and took my money to cover their cost. I will never shop with them again, I am a huge fan of Waterman, but I will get my pens from somewhere else from now on. Sometimes mistakes do occur, and that alone will not make me write a review like this. However, I did not like the way they handled their mistakes, such a HASSLE.

It indeed scans book pages without the dark lines around the binding line. If you have pages with contents printed very close to the binding line, you may have to adjust the scanning area and the book position, but most of the time, you have more than 5mm of blank margin near the binding line, and there is no problem.The image quality, build quality, scan speed, etc. compare with a general purpose flatbed scanner of 1/4 the price. If your main application is not scanning books, I do not recommend this scanner.One problem with this scanner is that it requires Microsoft Windows environment to work. It does not work with Vuescan on Mac or Linux. The only solution is to use a virtualization software (e.g., Parallels or VMware) or use Bootcamp function of MacOS Leopard, and run a copy of windows. If you do this, the scanner works fine on Mac OS.Another problem is that the software is not very good. It is buggy and awkward.However, these problems may be ok if you set up perfectly and keep scanning the whole book.Another problem is that this scanner is very slow. It takes 8 seconds to scan a page at 300dpi and then 4 more seconds before start scanning the next page. This is more time than I need to manually flip the page and place the book. The scanner needs improvement in this area. Ideally, I want the scan to complete in 3 seconds and proceed to the next scan in 1 second. If this is realized with less than doubling of the price, I'd give it a 4.5 star rating.I use this scanner to scan old, borrowed, out-of-print books in the field of my research. If the book is currently in print, or abundant in used market, I think it is best to buy a second copy, break the binding, and scan it through ScanSnap or similar document scanner. This way, you can save a lot of work and time. The desktop ScanSnap is a truly a 5-star product for scanning documents.Another area this scanner can be limiting is the scanning area. It can scan US letter size or ISO A4 size. However, some magazines and art monographs use page size larger than what this scanner can handle. What would be very nice is an ultrafast tabloid scanner that uses SEE technology and real TWAIN interface and works with any scanner software.

I only have laptops so now its much easier to bring the scanner to where I am working then go to where the scanner is set up. And this scanner even works in vertical mode if space is an issue. Another cool thing is it auto senses what you are scanning. With older scanners you had to preview what you were going to scan and then show the area you want scanned, which takes even more time and can sometimes be frustrating. Not with this baby. Simply slap whatever you want scanned in it and you are all set. And the Z lid is great for scanning thick items like books or thick charts.

Luckily, my husband handles everything for me, and I would most certainly be lost without him.  Recently, he came across the BIC Cristal For Her Ball Pen while doing some temporary work at the nearby women's college.  He told me it was like daycare there (which made me sympathize for their husbands because I've heard college is expensive), and the male staff really helped the women out by teaching them valuable college level knowledge such as writing.  But working as an engineer, a scientist, a journalist, and a politician at the college, my husband noticed that it was only possible for these women to learn the complicated practice of writing because of these women pens which were brilliantly designed by men.  I believe you just hook up the pen to your uterus, and the pen does the rest for you!  It is quite an amazing product, and ever since my husband gave me my very own, I have put it to good use.  Now I can create shopping lists, start a diary, and write home ec. textbooks.

274676,AY9SSM2CJ5RTA,B000LYAX1G,A. Thompson,"[14, 15]","I have had this phone about a month now.  Overall I like it, and it has some fun, new features.  But there are some very basic things missing that I dislike almost enough to return it (if only I could find something better, which so far, after reseraching 2 dozen other phones, I haven't).  I'll try to break it down here so you can decide if the pros make the cons worth it or not for you:PROS:- Great sound clarity, even on speakerphone. The phone can be several feet away and I can still hear and be heard just fine on speakerphone.- Great range.  I can use it outside all around the yard without any loss of signal or clarity.- Great battery life.  I don't panic if the phone is off the base at night.  I've never seen it show less than 3 bars of battery life yet.- I do like that you can adjust the ring volume on, or mute, each handset separately.- ""Night Mode.""  LOVE the ability to set each phone to automatically turn its ringer off at a certain time each night and on again in the morning.  So handy since the base is in our bedroom.  We set the ringer to turn off at 10pm and on at 8am so if someone decides to call at midnight, it will ring in the other rooms, but not in our room.  We can hear it in the distance if we're awake, but it isn't loud enough to wake us up if we're asleep.- It's not a huge pro, but the talking caller ID is occasionally handy. The downside is that it doesn't speak the caller's name until after the 2nd ring.  So mostly I end up answering it before I hear the caller's name or I see the handset before it says the caller's name.  But on the rare occasion thst I'm far from the phone, it does give me an idea of whether or not to sprint for the phone or let it go to the machine.- I like the silver and white color.  I doesn't look like a TV remote.  And the shape is easier to hold than some of the new flat and long shaped phones.- I've already dropped each handset several times and no ill effects.  Not even a battery cover flying off!- Love that it runs on rechargeable AA batteries.  Should the day come that they wear out, I can replace them with ones from the store. No need to order one from the company.- Call Block. I've only used this a once so far, but the ability to block solicitors or other unwanted callers is nice. (You just choose that option from the ""save"" menu after the call.)- Each handset can be used as an alarm.  This is so handy for us because my husband often gets restless at night and moves to the spare bed.  He used to have to set two alarms and then remember to turn off the bedroom one if he left so it wouldn't wake me up. Now he just sets the handset alarm and takes it with him if he moves to the spare bed.CONS:- By far the most annoying thing to me is that the answering machine records every hang-up.  If the person waits until the message starts and then hangs up, it is kept as a message instead of discarded.  So about half the messages I listen to are just a click, but I still have to take the time to listen and delete them.  It should have a better monitoring ability and not record those calls.- Similarly, if I pick up the phone after the ansering machine message starts, the answering machine doesn't shut off.  It records my whole conversation. So then it's broadcast over the answering machine speaker to the whole house, PLUS I have to delete it later.- Answering machine does not the show number of messages.  No Panasonic model has this feature (I even called the company to ask). However, the handsets do say ""New Message"" if there is a message.  And the handsets/base have a light that flashes if there is a message.  And once you push the button to play the messages, it will tell you how many there are before playing them.  I wish Panasonic would enter the 21st century and put a digital display with the # of messages.- Handsets all say ""missed calls"" almost all the time (but not the exact number of missed calls).  Any time any call comes in that you don't pick up, it says this on the handsets instead of the time and date.  So you have to scroll through all of them to get it to show the time and date again.  Annoying when all you want is to see the current time.  (But at least once you view them on one handset, the ""missed calls"" disappears from all the handsets.)- There are only four, very similar, ring tones to differentiate callers.  My old Uniden had about a dozen, and I used almost all of them.  Panasonic's choice of 4 classical melodies or 3 rings (two of which are jarring) is awful.  Especially considering that there is an alarm feature on each handset.  I wouldn't want to wake up to any of those shrieking alarm tones!- There is no beep or tone to let you know there is a message waiting.  Vtechs have this feature, which I love.- No speed dial.  Why do so many cordless phones lack this super useful feature?  Yes, there is a phone book in the memory. But do I really want to scroll through that whole thing to dial the people I call most?  NO.Overall, I'd say I like this phone.  I especially like the clarity and the battery life.  Some of the features are less intuitive to use and you might have to look at the manual a few times to get the process down.  But once you get them down, they are very handy and unique to Panasonic phones.  If I could find another phone that came close to this one, even without a couple of the fun features, I'd probably get it to replace the annoying answering machine issues. But between AT&T;, Vtech, and Uniden, no one even comes close.  Panasonic is definitely the leader in cordless phones right now.  If they would just tweek a few things with the answering machine and the ring tones, no one else would stand a chance.",3,"Some Great Features, A Few Annoying Ones",1273017600,"05 5, 2010",1081,14,15,0.933333333,helpful

749871,A3P6SDWL4YVG4Z,B003XNEZT8,Mr. & Mrs. Kramer,"[42, 47]","I have the weirdest (but great) story to share with you about this cart.Let me start from the beginning. I was at our local flea market searching for bargains and produce. I was already tired of carrying my bags of purchases and trying to hang them off my mobility scooter.See I can't walk much after 20 minutes, so on the longer journey's I have to take my mobility scooter. I've seen bunches of people hand towing these grocery carts so effortlessly I was envious of how challenging shopping can be on a mobility scooter, like we don't have needs also.A few months ago I was shocked to see an older man towing this cart behind his electric scooter. OMG. What an idea.Immediately I was fascinated at his incredible solution to my problem so I pulled up next to him and HAD to ask could all mobility scooters pull a wagon cart like his was doing. Apparently he was used to being approached and began to laugh. He was so nice and we chatted for a while. After looking at the back of my scooter he told me I would be able to pull a cart also.He said I needed to buy something called a ""JCV hitch"" to be able to make it happen. He bought his off the internet.I was so excited. Soon as I got home I googled JCV hitch and found it. It was for sale on ebay. I love ebay for the feedback ratings so I know which sellers I can trust by their track able past record. I ordered it for about 90 bucks. (maybe I should have looked for a lower price, but I wanted it now)I then ran to amazon to order the grocery cart the old man was pulling. I love amazon for the reviews so I know which products I can trust. I pretty much only buy from amazon or ebay as the rest of the internet sellers scare me a little since I've never heard of them. Who are they? Where are they from?In a week I had them both. I was surprised how big the box was amazon sent me. How could they afford to give free shipping on something this big? Don't blame me if amazon is giving away their profits with free shipping.I opened it. It wasn't the color I had hoped for, but so what. I didn't care as long as it worked. The tires were NOT installed on the cart. I began to worry as I'm the type of person that screws up everything that has to be assembled.Nervously I read the instructions. Great they were well written and clear. To my joyous surprise I had the tires on in less than five minutes with no tools needed, thank God. Wow, even a moron like me could do it. If you can't put the tires on, you don't want to hear my opinion of you... Nuff said.I was stunned by how light the cart was. Totally effortless to pick up and carry anywhere, but I was scared that meant cheaply built and future problems. Oh well, I would find out. I wanted to hurry up and hook the new super cart to my mobility scooter. First I had to connect that JCV hitch thingy to my scooter. Piece of cake, it fits perfectly.Then to hook up my new blue cart to the jcv hitch. It was a tighter fit than I expected (maybe sloppy isn't good), putting the cart handle into the hitch, but it still took me less than 30 seconds with a little bit of belly dancer wiggling to get the pointed thingy through the handle hole. My excitement had definitely arisen and I couldn't wait to climb on and take control. I needed this.FAST FORWARD... Now several months later.The cart is very well built for being so light and holds as much as I wished for. My tires are still staying on. Yay... I love the fabric is water proof and rain doesn't get in. I know, I shouldn't be out in the rain. I remember what my mother said so leave me alone.But when you're at the far end of a giant flea market and without warning it begins to rain on a sunny day, it takes me over ten minutes to get out the gate with the other stampeding idiots all fleeing just like me to get out of there and back to the safety dryness of our vehicles. I shouldn't have even bothered attempting to escape the rain. By the time I got back to my minivan, I couldn't have gotten any wetter if I had stayed. No, I dont carry umbrellas on sunny days.I was delighted to discover all my purchases were completely dry unlike me. 1 out of 2 ain't too bad.I wouldn't mind melting a little bit. I can stand to lose a little weight says my husband who is so romantic.I also love the built in zippered pockets on the shopping cart. Lots of times things like my wallet, sunglasses etc,  I don't want buried in the bottom of the cart where I can't get to them quickly. I also love that people can't see what I have in my cart. Theft begins with nosey prying eyes I think. They can't just reach in and quickly grab something and run thanks to the draw string and flap.Unintentionally I have been forced to overload the cart several times in my opinion. No its never my fault, doesn't everyone know that yet?  I wouldn't have been surprised if I broke it or ripped the fabric, but to my great joy it seems able to overcome any abuse I can dish out. It's great to have a cart that is tougher than me. But that's not a quality I any longer want in husbands.Originally I bought the wagon cart just for hauling various shopping cargo with my mobility scooter. The scooter baskets are ridiculously small in my opinion and this cart is the perfect solution.Little did I know (and that happens way too frequently-but it's still not my fault) back then how handy this cart would turn out to be. I never take it out of my van cept to carry groceries into the house with. Then it quickly goes back into the van so it's always with me.You see I'm not the brightest lighbulb on the planet (you figured that out already) and too many times I can't foresee when I will have a need to tote lots of stuff for whatever unexpected reason pops up, and they do. Trust me on that.Way too many times at the last second I realize I don't want to carry (whatever) them things with me as I continue my excursion unexpectedly further. But since my new cart is always in the van just a minute away, I feel great and smart at being able to avoid my own torture as my solution is already there. Thats more than I can say for my husband.Now I am actually learning to take it into all the stores with me as it's so light it's never an inconvenience even if I don't need it. It folds up real small so you almost don't take up any room in your vehicle.I had to pick up a large box at fedex. (don't ask why they won't deliver to my door) My sister sent me a real big box of bedding stuff after her divorce and moving out. It wasn't too heavy, but it was way too big and awkward to carry by hand.Miraculously (sometimes I can surprise myself) I remembered the fabric bag of the cart can slide off and then the cart can be used as a hand truck. Thank God for Velcro. The manufacture made it so easy and quick to take the bag on or off.I carried my little make shift hand truck into fedex feeling totally brilliant. The counter girl helped me tape the box to my cart frame. It was so fun wheeling it out to my van as I thought that just a few months earlier, how torturous this would have been on me. It's about time somebody is nice to me. Even if I have to do it myself. &lt;grin>Bottom line... This cart is great and I can't find its flaws cept for the fact I should have owned one year's earlier. My daddy says better late than never. Maybe it's his fault I was a late bloomer. I need to be able to blame someone. It couldn't be my fault, could it?  ....I didn't think so.Several times I have had up to seventy (70 lbs) pounds of stuff in this cart. I have to give it an ""A plus or 5 stars"" in the following areas.Low purchase cost.  ...I know, that means nothing to you.Fantastic durability.  ...It puts up with me better than my husband or boyfriends do.Folds up small.  ...Like I used to be.SUPER lightweight.  ...Like I used to be.Well designed and though out.  ...Better than my marriage arrangement.Doubles as a hand truck for them emergencies.  ...no comment.Water proof.  ...That's more than I can say for myself.The tires don't fall off. &lt;grin>The top flap cover is convenient to open for getting stuff in or out.  ...As it ought to be.Has zippered pockets. Mine had 2, but some people's reviews say theirs only had one.  ...Lucky me.It's balanced well so it's easy to pull and use no matter how heavy I make it by overloading. Who cannot like that?But for me, best of all, I can pull it with my electric scooter on all the longer trips. No more hanging bags over my shoulders, off the handle bars, putting bags of vegetables between my feet for quick bruising on the floorboard, or perpetually wishing my basket was bigger.I've read some people even take them to Disney Land.  ...Wish I could go.Thanks ebay and amazon.Thanks for listening to my crazy rave.

However, I never got a single good printout from this printer using Illustrator CS or InDesign CS on my Macs. Color saturation levels were truly awful no matter what I did to fix them. Playing with Gamma didn't help much, either. I have heard that the pigment based inks used with this printer will by nature print lighter and compensation will be necessary. Perhaps this is true. However, I need a printer that I can use today without spending hours messing with saturation levels and ""faking"" colors so they'll print the way I want them. No other Epson printer that I've owned has had this kind of problem.My guess is Adobe and Epson need to figure out what's going on and fix this issue ASAP. Until I know it's fixed, I can't recommend this printer to anyone except perhaps Photoshop users, and even then it's only because others recommend it for Photoshop.Sooooo, if you're going to use this printer for what it's made to do -- print photographs, and print them well -- go for it.

We owned panasonic phones for about 6 years, purchased new ones and within a month the numbers were rubbing off.  So we returned them and based on these reviews bought this phone.  Out of the package, one of them didnt work, so we returned them immediately for a replacement.  First complaint is these phones took 3 days to charge the first time.  And beware... if you leave a phone off the charger and the battery runs low, it will take another 2-3 days to charge completely.From day one I found these phones difficult to navigate,  but I chalked it up to being different from our old phones.  No big deal.The sound quality on these is NOT good.  We have a difficult time hearing most phone calls, even though the volume is high, and the sound cuts off if there is outside noise (such as someone in the room talking, music, my kids yelling, etc.)  It reminds me of the cutting out some speaker phones do.  I am constantly saying What?  What? and can you repeat that?And now, 2 months after our purchase, the ringer has blown on one of the handsets.  It sounds like when a car stereo speaker goes.  So every time the phone rings it sound like crazy static.We dont use the phones for anything other than normal household use, and we dont even have a teenager(haha) so its not the phones are used that much.  The one with the blown speaker was in an upstair bedroom and was rarely used.We'd like to return them, and we dont want replacements.  I'll go back to panasonic.

However, I am forced to give this a one star because I have now paid Fujitsu over $800 and I don't have a scanner.  What happened?  Well, I bought my first S1500 about a year ago.  Absolutely loved it. I could scan anything from legal documents to photographs.  Literally everything with the push of a button. And it was converted into a .pdf in a snap.  Scannnn...SNAP.  It was that easy!  At 50 ppm, I scanned hundreds of pages in a matter of minutes.  I loved it.  Until it died. Just stopped working. Frustrated, I checked the warranty and it had just expired!  Darn the luck!  So I shelled out another $400+ and bought a second one this last November. My wife had a pile of professional paperwork stacking up and I was frustrated at doing one page at a time in our old scanner.  I counted down the days 'till I got my new ScanSnap.  What a great day it was!  Once again, I was back to scanning...professional paperwork, documents, even things that I just wanted to digitize and archive, like birth certificates and old phone numbers. I was scanning like a madman!  Until tonight. Four months after I opened the box, I am sitting next to yet another dead ScanSnap.  Luckily, this one lasted less time than the first, so I think it might still be under warranty. Maybe. But why should I be worrying about that with only a four month old piece of equipment?  That I cannot tell you, but it's true.  This is probably one of the greatest scanners ever...but I'm not sure if I can bear to own another.Update...23 March 2010...I called customer service (even before the reply to my post was posted) and within minutes, I was talking to a human customer service representative.  I explained the problem to him, and he told me it sounded like a bad power supply.  No problem, he took my address and said he'd have one in the mail the next day.  Sure enough, not a week later and I had a new power supply!  And the scanner works great again!  Very happy with it.  The only reason it isn't five stars is because this is apparently a rather common problem.

After years of less than careful use, the time has come where replacing the batteries won't resurrect them.My requirements for a replacement were pretty simple:1) I have voicemail, so an answering machine wasn't necessary2) There must be some kind of voicemail notification3) 5.8 GHz or DECT, to play nice with my wireless networks4) Speakerphones in the handsetI've had pretty decent luck with Motorola products in the past (both cordless and cell phones), and I liked the design of these handsets. The price was right, too, so I placed my order.My first impression upon receiving the phones was that the handsets felt very cheap. A couple of good drops, and I'm certain they'll crack or shatter.Motorola seems to want theirRAZRkeypad to carry over to as many products as possible, including their cordless phones. On these phones, the keypad is rubberized, which isn't too bad until you start using automated phone systems... then it becomes a royal pain to deal with, if you're quick with a keypad.The voicemail indicator is an icon on the screen. Maybe VTech has spoiled me, but I was expecting to see a blinking light somewhere. So, you have to check your handset to see if you have a message, rather than notice a blinking light. Not a major problem, but disappointing all the same.Where the Motorola cordless phones really fail is call quality, though. Several people complained that they couldn't hear me... if I could maintain a call with them for long enough to get a complaint. The other major, MAJOR problem, is that the handsets would all randomly hang up. Now... the base is located in the same place my old VTech phone was, connected to the same outlet on the same UPS, and using the same phone line (the jack was in good condition, so no need to replace it).I did all the normal ""move the base"", ""try a different jack"" steps that anyone would normally try with these problems, but to no avail.Eventually, I gave up and decided to get the VTechVtech DECT 6.0 Black/White Expandable 2-Handset Cordless Phone Systemwith an extra handset. To my surprise, the two phones are surprisingly (perhaps disturbingly) similar, from design right down to the batteries and instruction stickers.

Like many of you, I am not interested in buying a piece of furniture (Like a $1000.00 chair). I am interested in buying a comfortable chair that is going to last a while.PUTTING IT TOGETHER: The construction was fairly easy. It would have been even more easy if I had of paid closer attention to the actual instructions, but instructions are only for after I've messed up...not before hand. (Joking) . Anyway, the only issue I had was finding a good way to put the arms on the butt of the chair. It's awkward.The construction of the cylinder that holds the weight seems a little cheap, but has held up to my 190 pounds pretty well after a week. The plastic covering over the cylinder though could not look any cheaper, I promise you that. They might as well have put electrical tape in there and had you wrap that around some toilet paper rolls.Construction took me roughly 25 minutes...and all tools were included. Take care to separate all of the screws and washers before hand because they are somewhat similar.COMFORT:The chair is certainly comfortable, but the leather is like pleather. I'm sure that this is not authentic leather. If feels grainy and fuzzy.....not like real leather. It feels sticky at times.There are four adjustments you can make to this chair, and it gets confusing which one does which, so I'm going to go through them each as I'm sitting here. Let's start in the back...1.There's a knob, and it is a manual knob that you can turn to do the lumbar support thing. I like to keep mine all the way up.Now for the Levers2. First lever, if I'm working front to back: This lever is for the height of the seat. I keep mine all the way at the bottom because I'm five foot 7 and I like to be low.3. Second lever moves the entire upper and lower seat together, like its' on a rocker....do you want the seat to aim downward? That's your lever...I prefer to have it slightly upward. It's worth noting that this is a locking lever, which means you can leave it wide open if you'd like your chair to rock, but this chair is not a good rocker, at all.4. Third lever is for the back reclining only. It also is a locking mechanism, but I don't see the benefit in allowing it to be unlocked...it just makes me fall back even further than I want each time.PROS:Comfy, rigid seat with a good amount of cushion for my rear.Lots of ways to adjust how you like to sit.The chair seems to roll fairly easily.It Spins!

It handled all kinds of papers from receipts to carbon forms to magazine pages to paper in one stack.  For the most part it will take any mix of sizes and type of paper, but it is sometimes easier to scan separately and use the drag-and-drop PDF editor to combine the pages together.The included OCR software is very easy to use, OCRs and coverts the PDFs in the background.  The resulting PDFs are images of the original page with real text underneath, permitting searches and cut'n'paste.The output tray is one of the few weaknesses of the hardware.  Sheets emerging from the scanner tend to catch previous pages and push them, sometimes completely off the tray, but almost always into a fairly unruly pile.  It's worse if the documents are of mixed sizes.It really cannot handle photos at all.  I'm not sure what causes it, but the results on a glossy photograph are unusuable.  Far below the quality of other documents, with large color smears and other artifacts.  The feed mechanism is not gentle enough for pictures, either, so you'd want to use the included carrier sheet for any photos you really cared about, which defeats the document feeder aspect of the scanner.The software has flashes of brilliance and moments of stupidity.  The business card app does an amazing job of extracting data from all kinds of odd business card layouts... but it can't handle inverse text (white on a dark background) at all.  The multi-feed detection and the dialog that helps you recover is very nice, but the paper jam popup is different and uninformative.  You can continue scanning from almost any condition with the one blue button on the unit, but if you want to do anything unusual (like simplex scanning) you have to navigate to the tiny systray icon and pick it from the right-click menu.  It does a great job of eliminating blank pages and it can even split stacks of pages into many documents, but it *can't* split them up by original input sheets (unless you set it to leave in blank pages and split into 2-page documents). No one can be using the computer connected to the scanner because it steals focus at the beginning, end and for any error condition.Overall I'm extremely happy with it and expect it to eliminate many filing cabinets worth of old documents.

First impressions began with the packaging - it was &#34;green&#34; (minimal and without any Styrofoam peanuts), easy to open and arrived in great condition. The unit is well-built with a matte black finish and has casters that worked well on both hardwood floors and Berber carpeting. There is a small handle indentation on each side that makes moving the unit very manageable. We did a side by side comparison with a Fellowes 99ci (approx. $220) and concluded the Amazon Basics is actually better on many counts.A standard 8x11 page takes about 8 seconds to be shredded. Same when 5 pages were inserted at the same time. The maximum of 12 pages took a bit longer - 10 seconds. Unopened junk mail credit card offers (including plastic card) took about 7 seconds to shred. A CD took 5 seconds and a single credit card 3 seconds. The end result was especially impressive - the micro-cut definitely outshines the cross cut Fellowes (see attached photo).The only advantage of the Fellowes is that max capacity is about 17 pages vs. 12 for the Amazon Basics and the Fellowes worked at a slightly faster speed. But the level of security provided by the Amazon micro-cut shredder puts it way ahead of most other shredders.It would have been nice to have plastic liner bags and lubricating oil included.

I also wrote a review for it as well. There wasn't anything that was major or wrong with this printer but I really just wanted an upgrade with more features. I still like this printer, but I love the MX522!July 21, 2013....Updated review.....After owning this printer for some time I wouldn't recommend this printer for a business or home office. I had to print up 70 pages recently for a project and even though it printed well it did take some time for the pages to print. But it is still a good printer for home use if you just need to print a few pages daily. I still feel that the scanner features still needs more tools. I do have a Visioneer scanner and I use the Paperport software that came with it. So if I need major editing tools Visioneer is my go to scanner. It would be nice if Canon put some time into the scanner features then I wouldn't have to drop a star.This Canon printer is nice. I also own the Canon PIXMA IP100 Mobile Photo Printer since Feb 2009. I love that printer because it was mobile, small and printed beautiful photos as well as documents. But lately is started to have a few problems (going to have it repaired) that I had to put it on the shelf for this new Canon MX452. I really wanted something that was 100% wireless without sending it a cloud. This printer does everything that is says it will do and more. Printing, scanning, and faxing is a breeze! And it really is 100% wireless! I installed the software (CD) that came with the printer on my Windows 8 PC with no problems at all. There are a few programs that are helpful that work well with your printer. The Canon website also has the software on line, but then you have to install each program individually.I had to use the printer USB cable that came with the printer in order for me to connect wireless. But you may or may not need to use the cable like I had to in order to set it up. The software and cable came in handy and connected me right away. After 1 minute the printer recognized my network. I put in my network password and connected and then the installation CD asked you to remove the printer cable to then go wireless. The only cord that is used is the power cord and the telephone cord for the faxing. Best part is I can print now from anywhere in the house from my laptop or tablet and even my Android cell. Goggle play has a Canon app, but it's really not needed since mostly every program or web page has a print button to click on. Just make sure you don't turn off the printer power button. When the printer is not in use the printer will just go to sleep to reduce the power. But as soon as you click print or any other feature the printer will wake up immediately.Printing documents is sharp and clear. This printer uses 2 ink tanks (color & black). Most printer brands these days use 5 or more inks cartridges. So it really depends on how much color printing you use to notice any cost savings in using 5 tanks verses 2 tanks. So far the ink that came in the box is still going strong and has not run out. We use the printer for personal use everyday. The only thing I wish Canon would of spent more time in perfecting this printer is adding more tools to the scanning features of the printer. Needs work, but will get the scanning job done. This printer even has an area just for scanning photo negatives. Photo printing is really nice, but I didn't really purchase this for my photos. But overall for the low price and for everything that this printer does it is a purchase that I still recommend. But just make sure you do a comparison shopping before getting this one. I highly recommend the MX522 over this model.",4,A nice do-it-all printer!,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",707,220,241,0.912863071,helpful

Several years ago I bought a bunch of those brass plates you stick in the ground but have never used them. Then one day recently we saw someone else's labels in their garden and so I began researching label makers.I already have all the plant botanical and common names cataloged so I just wanted to transfer those to labels and this PT-2430PC makes it easy. Plug it in to a USB port, wait a few moments for the computer to recognize it, click on the program, and then I copy the name from Excel and paste it in the label entry box.

I didn't load the CD that comes with the printer because it didn't look like it had anything on it I would use.

When I bought it, it was being sold under the name ""Lexington Modern"", but is now ""LexMod"".UPDATE 3/22/13- I've been using this chair every day for nearly a year and a half without any issues to report.This office chair is ""styled"" after the Eames Aluminum Group Management Chair, with pneumatic lift and wheel caster options. But you probably already knew that. You probably also know that the real thing from Herman Miller costs ten times as much too! While this Chinese constructed chair costs significantly less than the iconic real deal, it is still a significant investment for those of us without a lot of disposable income, but have want for good quality, timeless mid-century designs. Long story short? This is a great buy overall; having bought two of these, I am very satisfied with the quality, in relation to the price I paid.Here's why.Construction and Assembly:These chairs come shipped in a large box in 4 pieces: assembled seat (consists of frame, leather backing, and armrests), stand/base, pneumatic lift/rod, wheel casters. No instructions included, but very easy to put together.Starting from the bottom up, the casters are a bit on the cheaper side, consisting of abs plastic wheels, with chromed plastic covers, and metal rod with retention ring. They snap into the base with relative ease. While the chromed plastic shields on top of the wheels look a little cheap and obvious (not metal), the casters rolled on my carpet rather well. Since the casters appear to be standard size, one could probably swap in higher quality metal casters if one were so inclined.The base itself is aluminum, matching the 5 star pattern of the real thing. It is machine polished, but not quite to a mirror finish, which is similar to the real deal. Pneumatic shock installs right into the base with no fuss. No signs of stress or sounds handling my hefty weight (over 200 lbs).The preassembled seat has a mirror finish machine polished aluminum frame and arm rests. These closely match the shape of the real thing, but does not quite match the finish of the base. The real Eames chairs that I have seen aren't quite polished to a mirror finish. There were some tiny areas on the frame and armrests where some polishing compound was not removed/polished off, but it came off easily. One of the arm rests on the pair of chairs i bought had a slight shimmy; I resolved it by tightening the allen fasteners that held the arm rests to the frame. Minor nuance.The leather on the seat itself is bound tightly to the frame, it seems to be of good quality, with acceptable stitching. No loose threads. The leather seat didn't bend or sag under my weight and seems like it will last a good while. Smells good too.The seat adjustment support frame consists of painted steel with chromed plastic end caps, and chromed plastic knobs and pulls. I am a little disappointed that the pneumatic adjustment knob is just a lightweight cheap chromed plastic piece, giving it a cheap feel(threaded polished heavier aluminum knob would look sweet), but luckily it isn't visually noticeable. Differing from the real deal, the tilt stop adjustment (also a chromed plastic knob) is on the front of the chair, instead of the back. There is also tilt lock rod, which is a welcome addition.Comfort:This is subjective, but I find this to be a very comfortable office chair. I am tall (6'0"") and large (in the slightly over 200ish range) and there is a bit of room to spare on my sides. It feels a bit stiff, but I prefer my office chairs to be like this, so that I don't doze off at my desk. Leaning back in this chair feels good.Concerns:I want to be concerned about the wear rate on the leather, but it doesn't seem like it will be an issue for years. As this is fulfilled by Amazon and covered through Amazon's comprehensive A-Z guarantee, there is little to worry about. Anyone shopping for these chairs should purchase it through Amazon for peace of mind.

I use a Kodak 6490 Digital camera and it produces great pics, especially on the Cannon Photo Pro paper. I haven't tried my old Epson paper as of yet. It is nice to have the option of not having to boot up my PC to review and print my pictures as well. I can use either the card reader or the USB port, SD card slot is easier. Nice to see store quality prints right out of your printer. Very quick and quiet! My old Epson created gloss and non-gloss areas on the photos, these are full gloss with color correct images. If you are going to do more text printing you might want to go with the IP4000 as it has a black pigmented base color for sharper text printing. I did print off some docs though and they looked just fine on this printer. I did a good deal of research and it would have been either the 4000 or 6000, for the ""best bang for the buck"".

After  plugging in the unit to my 350 MHZ Gateway running Win98, I ran the setup  program from the packaged CD and had scanned my first photo within minutes.  Shortly afterwards I decided I should probably get the latest driver.  I  went to Canon's web site and downloaded the current driver. It is probably  best to download the latest driver before running the setup disk that comes  with the scanner because the setup routine asks where the driver is located  and you have to select from the CD which could be months old.  If you do  like I did and initially get the driver from the CD, you need to go to  Device Manager and select Imaging Device-properties-Driver-Update driver.  Then you can browse to the location of the new driver that you downloaded  from Canon's website.

After reading many reviews I was leaning towards using an internet service but then I came across this printer and the reviews convinced me to take a chance--along with the 100 dollar rebate that brought the price down to 350. And while getting 4x6's done out of house are the cheapist way to go, those places aren't that cheap for doing 8x10, 8.5x11, 13x19, etc. I'm not saying using the Pixma will be cheaper than Snapfish printing large prints but the difference will be much less than if you just printed 4x6's. And it is very satisfying to whip out a large print of a nice pic you just took.So far it's like people say, lab quality, if not better prints, fast quiet printing and incredibly vivid colors. Although, it does tend to oversaturate the reds on default settings so take note of that. I wouldn't expect it to do great B&W; prints but I am not going to use it for that.The only paper I've used so far is Kodak Ultra Premium glossy, 4x6 and 8.5x11. I will also try the Canon and Ilford papers.I've only had this printer for a few weeks so I can't attest to its durability but it is a heavy and solid printer--and LARGE.

Soon after I got a call from the seller -- a truly remarkable guy, I must tell you.  He mailed me a free replacement -- and today I'm cranking my rating up to 5. THIS Key Finder works perfectly, protecting me from my own absent-mindedness by allowing me to ""page"" my cell phone, keys and purse when I misplace them. It's a great product.But just as amazing -- perhaps more so -- is the way this seller responded to my critical review. He called me not to quarrel, but because he's dedicated to assuring that every single one of his customers is wholly satisfied. Any seller of an electronic gadget will occasionally send out a glitchy item. But it's the rare merchant who goes out of his way to make things right for patrons who don't even bother to tell him something's wrong. THAT's the point worth noting here: I didn't call him; HE called me!It doesn't get any better than that. It never occurred to me that buying a key-finder could become an uplifting human encounter -- but that's how this turned out. To call this company trustworthy would be an understatement. I've been thinking lately that my seven siblings (who share my distractibility gene) might like to have Key Finders.  I'd really like to give this terrific fellow more business. . . .--------------------MY EARLIER REPORT: Well, wonders never cease!

Merely the thought of doing battle with the merchant exhausts me. . . .""As it happens, that's just the beginning of the story. I just got off the phone with the seller of this item, and I've never in my life had such a pleasant conversation with a merchant. He saw my review and came to ME asking to help solve the problem.

After hours of research with the emphasis that my new printer needed to have the advantages of a laser printer (high-speed, high-yield, long-term reliability) paired with the ability to natively print with wireless clients, such as AirPrint on iOS devices, I happened upon this fairly recent release from Brother. All of the early reviews I have read have been very positive, and I can say that my experience over the past month has also been overwhelmingly positive.Set-up was a breeze, followed the well-written instructions, and after plugging via ethernet into my network, I was immediately able to print from my iPhone, iPad, and Mac, as compared to previously using software to allow AirPrint via iOS on the HP inkjet which required the main computer to be on and connected to the network. Duplexing works great, the document feeder for envelopes worked as intended, and I look forward to a future without inkjet frustrations. Another bonus is that this printer (and it's bigger truly-wireless brother, the 5470) include a full capacity ink cartridge, not a 'starter' cartridge. Have already printed >1000pgs without issue. Will update this post after idea of capacity of the toner is more appreciated, but this easily paid for itself as I would have had to replace my previous ink cartridges 3 or 4 times by this point.Have recommended this to numerous family and friends and happily give it 5-stars here.To address other reviewers' points that this is not a wireless printer, I'll admit it was a little confusing, but the 5450 allows for 'wireless' printing from devices such as iPad to the 5450 which requires you to connect the 5450 to your network with an ethernet cable.

The Epson was fast, printed good quality documents and pictures, but it was an ink hog and I just couldn't afford new cartridges every month.I wanted a everything- decent print speed, good quality prints, efficiency, something that wouldn't guzzle ink, something simple to use, and something under $150.  A friend suggested a Canon, because he bought an S-series Canon for his business and had wonderful things to say about it.  I asked another techie friend his opinion and he said to go with a Canon, too.Seeing as how the I-series is basically a newer, upgraded S-series, I went with the i550.  Since then, I've been very pleased with the purchase.  Prints are beautiful, and documents printed are wonderful- letters are clear and crisp.  I was so pleased with it that I chose to with Canon again when I bought a scanner a month later.  I like that this printer also features 4 separate ink tanks, so I don't have to buy a whole new color cartridge when I'm only low on one color.The physical design of the printer is very nice, as well.  Some printers look hideous, but it's pretty sleek.  I also like how I can close up the printer when I'm not using it.  There are flaps you can snap shut to close up the paper feeding area and the output area where the prints come out.

Tuck one plastic liner in the neckline of your top, for an impromptu, impervious apron.4. Put the other liner on the counter. Put newspaper on top of it and 2 dry paper towels on top of that.

Remove the empty cartridge from the printer and bring it to the work area.7. Look at the bottom of the cartridge. If there are any specks of ink on it, wipe them off with a dampened Q-tip and dry with a dry one. Avoid  touching the electronic chip and the inside of the opening with the ink in it.8. Match the ink outlet on the bottom of the cartridge with the opening on the holder. Snap into place.9. Locate the small inlet port on the cartridge holder. Open the ink and place the tip in the inlet port.10. Hold a dry paper towel next to the T-shaped opening on the top of the cartridge. (If you go too fast or add too much, ink will flow out the  T-shaped opening and create a huge mess.)11. SLOWLY push the plunger one cc at a time. I usually use 3 cc for the regular cartridge and 6 cc for the XL. (Their full capacities supposedly are 4.5 cc and 8 cc.)12. When the cartridge is filled, wipe off your gloves. Leave your gloves on and put the cartridge in the printer.13. Run a print quality report to see if more ink is needed. If so, take the cartridge back to the kitchen and slowly add one more ml at a time.If the lines are smudged or wavy, clean the print head. (On the 410C, press the button with the tool icon and select print quality report.)14. When you're finished adding ink, rinse the holder under a thin stream of water until clear. Rinse both the large hole and the inlet tube.15. Dry the holder with a paper towel. Shake it to get any water drops out.16. Pack up the holder, ink, plastic bags, and Q-tips.

Simply measure and cut your segment, and then separate the plastic from the paper. (This is a little tricky, and I recommend kneading a corner with your fingernails until the plastic is separated.) After this, simply peel it off and apply onto your surface. Then smooth out to rid of wrinkles and air bubbles. (I did this on a kitchen counter, seeing it was a hard and completely flat surface.)

341049,A1OQRGR7DWIUFW,B000WKSZ5A,Glenn,"[12, 12]","I am a professional illustrator and like most of you, I was in need of an affordable, reliable A3 sized scanner as most print work is done digitally today.  The Mustek ScanExpress A3 1200 Pro USB was a very attractive option for me.  At the time that I first needed an A3 scanner, options were far more limited.  Mustek's first offering in the A3 size was limited in terms of resolution and quality.  When this model was released I jumped on it and for the most part have been beyond satisfied with it.  Ease of installation, usage, quality of scans, reliability...many people complained about Mustek quality but I was a vocal advocate of them and I even spent an afternoon at Mustek's facilities in Irvine, CA talking with them about a grey market machine I was comtemplating buying.  I walked away feeling confident that Mustek was a solid operation and that I would receive whatever support I might require should I take the plunge and purchase one of their scanners, so I did.Although I always had my eye on a higher-end machine such as the Epson Expression XL 10000, I was satisfied with my Mustek until recently when it failed on me during a routine scan of line art @ 400 dpi.  At first I didn't know if the issue was software or hardware related.  In the midst of a job, in the middle of the night after an exhausting day at the board, under pressure to produce...this was NOT the time for me to get hung up on getting my work out to my client and inker.  I called Mustek the next day...we ran through the various troubleshooting points...came to the conclusion that unfortunately, the machine had to be sent in for repair @ $75.00 for the inspection and turn-around would be several weeks.  This would not do.  After resisting the impulse to destroy my machine in a fit of rage, I calmed down and decided to open it up to see if I could figure out what was going on.  Two screws are all that holds the top portion, including the glass, to the lower base.  After lifting off the top, I noticed that the black ribbon attached to the CIS device (anyone who owns this machine and looks down into the bed of it will recognize what I'm talking about) was kinked and mangled.  Somehow the ribbon was getting hung up beneath the moving bar and causing the scan to be interrupted...error message read ""Scanner failed to reset"" or something like that.  This ribbon is held down to the base of the device by a piece of double-sided sticky tape.  That's it.  And somehow the ribbon was pulled up and knocked-off it's path.  So had I sent in the machine it would have cost me a minimum of $70, possibly my gig because of a failure to deliver, possibly another machine because I may not have been able to wait for the repair to come back...just boggles my mind.  And even after I tacked down the ribbon and tried to smooth it out after being kinked up, the issue presented itself again and the machine continued to hang up.  This will not do.  Every time I scan some work I cannot sit back in fear of the device getting hung up and quitting until I remove the top and re-tape the ribbon to the base.The Mustek is a wonderful entry-level machine and it served my needs well until it failed.  Even though it still functions, at this point it is too unreliable for me and I'm going to upgrade to a machine of higher construction quality as well as scan quality.  I want to be clear that I'm not trashing the Mustek.  It paid for itself several times over for the years I used it and as an entry-level machine, or a scanner for the hobbyist, it is a great option.  But at this point my needs have outgrown it.  So for anyone who experiences the same issue I did...before chucking your scanner, sending it back, etc, try the remedy I did:  Remove the top via the two screws and check that black ribbon.  If it's kinked or stuck beneath the thin CIS bar, you have the same problem I did and try flattening out and re-taping the ribbon to the base.

I purchased it to compliment my desk printer.  I was looking for a printer I can take with me on vacation, to weddings, family gatherings, business events, etc., and this little machine fits the bill to a &quot;T&quot;.  You just take the memory card from your digital camera, (it accepts SmartMedia, CompactFlash Type I and II, and Memory Stick cards), and plug it into the printer, and away you go.  When you plug in your memory card the display panel on top of the printer indicates how many photos are on the card.  You can print an index page of thumbnail size proofs of all the pictures on your memory card, then selectively print just the photos you want.  Optional print sizes are 4x6, Wallet (2.5x3.25), or Thumbnail (0.7x0.9).  You can choose to print a single, or multiples of the same photo. You can also choose to print a range of photos (e.g. print single or multiples of index numbers 21 through 25).  What a boon for taking with you on vacation!  If you fill your memory  card, you can make a print of each photo when you get back to the hotel, erase the card and start over taking new pictures. When you get home you can scan the prints into your computer, with the option of making enlargements.  At special events, guests can go home with a souvenir print of the event.  I am very pleased with the quality of the prints and the convenience and ease of use of the printer.  You will only get borderless prints if you use the HP 4x6 Premium Photo paper with the tear off tab.  Other brand 4x6 papers will print with a narrow border.  The printer's compact size and weight (just under 3lbs) make it extremely portable, and I like the instant gratification of a print without having to take the time to store them in the computer first, (also a great point for those who are thinking of a digital camera, but don't have a computer).  The only thing I would have liked is a double power source (i.e. rechargeable battery as well as AC), but that, of course, would increase the price.  There is a padded carrying case made specifically to fit this printer.  It has a front zippered pocket to hold the AC adapter, a spare ink cartridge, a box of printing paper, and a pocket to store prints and/or user's manual.

The scanned result looks like it had specks of dust and scratches in the image. I scanned the same picture in a diferent position in the scanner, and I got diferrent results. It still had spots and scratches in different places. Called Epson and their answer was that the picture was deffective. They sent me to an Epson Service center, and the scanner spent a week in repairs. At the end nothing was acomplished. I had to return the scanner to amazon.com. I am looking for a new scanner. I hope Epson improves it's customer service department; it is worth nothing when it comes to trying to help a customer. The Epson service rep was always blaming the end user.

940165,A34VRVI4CSI5RQ,B005IVL0RS,Matthew K. Morgan,"[28, 30]","The Epson WorkForce 845 is an all-in-one printer/scanner/copier/fax machine that is suitable for small offices and home businesses. It's priced right for that market segment and is a fine printer for most tasks that can be thrown at it.Set-up of this printer is nearly painless. It is actually more of a struggle getting the printer out of the box than it is to configure it for use. Once out of the box and on th desk, it requires removing the packing tape (in place to protect the printer during shipping), plugging in the ink cartridges and then waiting the requisite 5 minutes while it primes the cartridges. After this process completes, load the drivers, connect the printer at the right time and then it's ready to go.My first order of business was to print a test page and it dutifully cranked out a very clean, crisp print of the Epson test page. There is no banding, no smears and no disjoint lines as I have seen on older Stylus models. This is a big plus right out of the box.Epson has adopted a standard touch screen model for manipulating their all-in-one printers and this one is no different. Switching between the different modes requires a light tap on the LCD screen to move from printing to copying to scanning, and everything is very logical and straightforward. One thing that surprised me is the printer's ability to generate ruled papers such as wide ruled classroom paper and even graph paper. It even has the ability to generate note paper with a watermarked image. This is a nice feature, though it's not one I will personally use.Print quality is good. As I mentioned above there is no banding and no jagged lines. Photo print resolution is excellent as well, producing frame-suitable prints.One of the really excellent features of this printer is the ability to connect wirelessly to a network, which makes setting up the printer anywhere very simple. Entering the security key on the screen is a minor inconvenience but it is not absurdly hard.The printer does a very nice job of duplex printing. It is fast and it's automatic, not requiring manual intervention.One thing that has surprised me about this printer, however, is that the print speed is not exceptional. The test page itself took roughly 5-10 seconds to print which may not seem like a lot of time but is noticeably slower than some other printers with which I have worked. It is likely not going to be a show-stopper issue, but it is worth noting. Copy speeds are slower than print speeds as expected but are not unreasonable.Epson includes the extra-high-capacity cartridges in the box with the printer. This is excellent. Most printers come with ""starter"" ink packs which don't last long. From what I can ascertain from Epson's specs, these should be good for about 500 pages. Time will tell.The document feeder works well. It is nice to be able to put pages on top of the printer, hit the copy button and have the printer automate the whole process of feeding, copying and collating.The Epson WorkForce 845 is a nice all-in-one device. It has reasonable print speeds, the output is quality and the list of features is impressive. This one costs a little more than the entry-level printer you'd find at the local electronics store but the features and print quality outweigh that price difference. If you're looking for a midrange all-in-one, this is a good one to consider.",4,Very Good Midrange All-In-One,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",582,28,30,0.933333333,helpful

The binder rings are mounted to the back and not the spine which makes it a little wider. When you open it, there is a standard pocket on the right which might hold a sheet of paper or two. The rings are mounted on the right as well. To the left of that is the spine, then, on the inside cover, is a large expandable pocket that closes on the top with a button on the pocket and elastic on the flap that goes over the button for closer. The pocket expands maybe 1/2 inch.The binder appears made well. The rings are a little different in that when they close, one side has a pin that goes into a hole in the other side, so they don't get offset. This should allow for easy paper turning. As far as that goes, it is OK.I give this three stars, however, because the button on the pocket intefers with the paper in the binder. This has two manifistatins. First, if you write on the back of a page, the paper is partially on the pocket so you have an uneven surface which can cause the pen to go through the paper or disrupt the writing. Second, if you close the binder with the paper open (that is to say like a book that is open with some pages on the left and some on the right), during closing, those on the left get snagged by the button and can wrinkle or rip. This could have been solved by a simpler closure (velcro or fold in the pocket) but as it is it is inconvenient for the button and elastic to stick out.The binder does not have any plastic leaves on the rings that allow the paper to lie flat against something.

When I bought the C88 (the old name for this printer), after a month it started spewing ink all over the place. A long distance call to Epson resulted in them sending me a new one. Two weeks into using the new one, my color cartridges were half full. I found this extremely odd as I only printed black text. Now, 4 weeks later, several of my color cartridges are empty, and I still haven't printed anything in color! Makes you wonder where the ink is going. Well, it isn't going anywhere. Removal of the cartridges proved that they were still full. Blowing the printer heads was no help. My black cartridges are still almost full, but I can't get the printer to print correctly, I keep getting inkless bands across my text. Blew the heads several times but it didn't help. I wrote to Epson, they answered back with their standard formatted reply: call us. Long distance, no 800 number, so we can tell you once again we will replace the printer. No thanks!

Although I am a computer programmer by trade, I wanted a more portable graphing solution for some of the rather complicated equations involved in long range target ballistics.I first bought a TI-89 Platinum calculator - worked nicely, the UI was relatively intuitive, but it was fairly slow. So I started looking at HP and upscale TI graphing calculators. The TI Nspire seemed a good fit so I bought a regular one at a local office supply store. Unfortunately, the model I bought lacked some functionality I wanted which I found was provided by the CAS version of the same model line. Thus my purchase of the TI Nspire CAS calculator.Important note to users of other/past graphing calculators: the Nspire line from TI is very focused on teaching math at high school and college levels. It's document based UI is more like a computer program than the old million button scientific graphing calculators before it.The keyboard is three part:top: navigation, both on screen (touch pad) and primary menus/featuresmid: numeric and basic operators along with some more menus and shortcut keysbot: alphabetic keyboard (not QWERTY!) for entry of function names and such along with some special function keysPros:1. Fast - the calculations and graphing are significantly faster than on my TI-89 Platinum.2. Extensive built in library.3. Document based UI - once you get used to it, you'll probably like it a lot.4. Scratchpad feature - easily use as calculator or for graphing without interrupting current document.5. Nice screen size and resolution.6. Programmability.7. Very solid feeling, well built.8. Nice feel to the upper and middle keyboard areas.Cons:1. Inadequate documentation - very little on the internal function libraries. I end up using my TI-89 manual much of the time.2. A bit large and awkward.3. Trackpad functionality is iffy at times. Doesn't always respond right away.4. No backlight for the LCD - easy to use in well lit classrooms but not so much in low light situations. This is common in these calculators.5. Not as much real world usage support on line as other calculators e.g. TI-8x series.6. Bottom keyboard (alphabetic) keys are very small and click too much. Would prefer same feel as the rest of the keyboard instead.Bottom line - it is a great calculator, well built, solid feeling, versatile. However, it is definitely a teaching tool. I expected more of a traditional calculator with a manual for real world use.

The typical ones I've been buying at store, never last and the trimline look is so dated.So I went with this one, because it's retro and has caller id.  One thing noted is that this says GE but the phone actually says RCA, so I don't know if mine is a left over from some merger, but it works great and has good sound.One of the big concerns I read here was about it being too light and pulling it off the table.  Well, they must have fixed that, because this is somehow engineered on the bottom so that it doesn't move.  In fact, if you want to move it closer, you can't pull it with the cord, you've got to reach over and pick it up.  That works for me.Getting used to the phone buttons has been a challenge.  I knew that they would not be in little rows like trimline phones, but I guess I assumed they would be set like dial phones of days of old.  They are not.

If you run a small business and think you'll be able to wirelessly network multiple computers to this printer, lots of luck. Really.

Canon replaced the printer within a week, thanks to them. Replacement works fine. I printed about 15 images in 13x19 size and a few smaller ones. Images were taken by Sony F717 camera and were of 5 and 3 MP size. No enhancements or editing were used, only best images, perfectly looking on screen were selected.1. I had problems with printer driver installation (eMachines PC, Windows XP Home edition). Gauge of driver installation program shows 60% when it fails to continue. Fortunately, printing is possible - the necessary parts of driver were installed.2. Color rendering may be better. It tends to add a little bit of extra violet tone. Colors are less bright than expected. Difference of how prints look on monitor and on paper are noticeable and it is impossible to predict them. However, no doubts, printed images are very good.3. I compared prints on Canon &quot;Glossy Photo Paper&quot; and on &quot;Photo Paper Pro&quot;. &quot;Pro&quot; - paper is much thicker, multilayered promising better prints. I am not sure about that because &quot;Pro&quot; paper is not so white as simple thin and twice cheaper &quot;Glossy&quot; so output on &quot;Pro&quot; is not so juicy. To ensure this, simply compare these two kinds of paper.4. I estimate ink expense for 10 13x19 images as 3 ink tanks, so each print comes to $5-$7, rather well. However, expenses in future in not often occasional usage should be bigger because ink dries in all ink jet printers, requiring cleaning of nozzles.5. Five MP images look very detailed, I would say that they are significantly better than may be expected from traditional 24*36 mm films. Even prints 3 MP images are very good showing no visible granularity.6. Printer is noiseless, relatively small, very fast and easy to use - though these features are not very important, this should be mentioned.Overall conclusion: this is a remarkable printer and it appears that it has no competitors, except, maybe, more expensive but less good by specifications Epson 2200. It is interesting to compare them. My suggestion to all serious photo amateurs with high demands looking for large format printer is &quot;buy&quot;.

For more money you can probably get something that's faster with slightly higher quality, but if your needs are home use this printer should be perfect.Positive points:1. Easy to setup and use - The printer came with simple 1-2-3 directions that made it very simple to setup and connect it to my computer and phone line. Make sure you have a USB port on your machine otherwise you won't be able to connect it!2. Functional software - The software is excellent! A helper application pops up upon insertion of paper for scanning, faxing, or copying. The application makes it very easy to accomplish any of these tasks. For example, to scan in a photograph you insert a photo, click on scan on your computer screen, and choose the photo option. This automatically sets scanning parameters to be optimized for photographs.3. Crisp and clear quality - Black and white text and color pictures appear to come out well. Print quality is user definable (tradeoff between speed/ink and quality). I have only used regular paper for printing photographs, but I've found the quality to be above average. I have heard that with photo quality paper photos look excellent (beware, this paper is $$$).4. Small form factor - The footprint is small enough to keep on your desk or on a small pedestal.5. Document feeder - The document feeder makes it simple to automatically scan in multiple documents. For example, I put a stack of 15 pictures on the feeder and it did a fairly good job of scanning them into different files.Negative points:1. Slow - This is not a business printer, and should not be expected to print as fast as one. The print speed is swift at low qualities (which should be adequate when you need to print directions), but can take its time when printing at the highest quality.2. Can't scan small items - It's difficult to scan small items because the document must be fed into the document handler (versus placed on a flatbed). For example, you cannot easily scan business cards. The flatbed HP printer would solve this problem, but you lose the ability to automatically scan in multiple documents.3. Ink is expensive - Ink is expensive, and if you're printing a lot you'll go through it fairly quickly. I've heard that it's possible to find kits to replace the ink on your own, but I have no information as to how that affects quality and performance.",5,Lots of bang for the buck!,995760000,"07 22, 2001",431,59,59,1,helpful

I found the setup to be easy and the quality of the print and scanning to be great.  The printer is quiet.  It does not work with our older desktop running Millinieum Edition operating system (came out before XP and after 2000) but it is not advertised to do so.  I bought it to work with our laptops and it does that well.Wi-Fi printers connect to the computer through the wireless router.  The initial setup includes telling the printer (through a hard connected computer) the name of your router and if you have protection on it (and you should) you also need to tell the printer the password.  If you set up the router, it should not be an issue.  If you did not, you will want to find out this information before attempting setup.  I set ours up so other than locating the information it wasn't an issue for me.  The instructions assume you know about this stuff, the setup disk does not provide a lot of coaching on this point (or possibly it does and I did not find it because I didn't need it).  There is support available from Lexmark too.If you want to be able to print from several computers, especially if they are connected to the internet with a wireless router already, then I think Wi-Fi printers in general are a great way to go.  All that has to be on to use the printer is the router, printer, and computer (no central host computer is necessary).

To summarize, if you lose something due to heat exposure, there is a very good chance you can get it back.My not-so-scientific scientific experiment:For my experiment I used Frixon Point 04 in purple, blue, pink, and green (darkest color to lightest).On the left side of the paper, I used a hair dryer to make the ink disappear (happened within seconds).On the left side of the paper, I erased using the frixion nub.I then placed the sheet of paper in the freezer.heat exposed side: Purple came back the best, followed by blue and pink (tie), and green did terrible.  Purple looked almost pre-heat-exposure quality while blue and pink were easily readable.  Green was visible, but very hard to make out.  Conclusion: freezer method works great for dark colors for accidental heat exposure.  Light colors did terrible.nub frixion side: Not so good.  If you use the nub and (for some reason) want it back, you will get something from the darker colors, but it will be light.  I can just barely make out the light colors, but perhaps a longer freezer exposure will help.CONCLUSION: if you lose something via accidental heat exposure or frixion nub error, you can likely retrieve it via placing in freezer for a few minutes (though you'll have to squint harder on the lighter colors).I would also note that once the paper returned to room-temperature after removal from the freezer, the colors DID NOT fade.I love the pens. I agree with other reviews, that the ink runs out fast and the nub should be at the end of the pen cap.  I get annoyed having to remove the cap every time I want to erase.  You shouldn't use the pens for legal documents (since they are erasable and you would never complete a legal document in pencil) or documents you submit to someone else (you don't know that THEY won't accidentally subject the document to heat, thereby rendering the page blank, and they won't know to stick the darn thing in the freezer).",4,regarding heat-fading issue: you can get it back,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",351,84,90,0.933333333,helpful

790454,A3JQUVUKHTVRML,B0046LV6QG,Shock Writer,"[91, 93]","History/Experience:This is my report after owning the Brother HL 4570 cdwt color laser printer from 4-2011 to 2-2012 about 10 months and printing 17,814 page faces using about 35 reams of paper.I needed a replacement for my old industrial strength Hewlett Packard HP 4500 laser which cost $2,400 new. This $550 machine is lighter duty yet fine for internal business documents, some color images, and for black-&-white letters that you send out.Toner Use:I print about 3 reams of 20 lb white paper, 1,500 papers, a month of double sided for about 3,000 page surfaces a month (double sided) with about 40% of the total pages in color. These statistics are available on the printers webpage that will come up in your web browser if you go to the Mac OS ""system preferences - printer"" and find the option for printer setup ""show printer webpage"". They are slow in coming up. On the first page home page the mono and color counts are found.Screen-print them, the color and mono page counts, when you put new cartridges in AND screen print them again when you replace a cartridge. Subtract the smaller number from the larger to get the number of pages of color and mono for those cartridges. My color cartridges are used up about at the same rate when using the Brother driver; the color sync driver on Mac may give a different result if it combines slightly different amounts of color to achieve a given in-between color.The cartridges look the same with the lower capacity ones just being less full. The lesser TN-310 low capacity size toner cartridges don't have much toner in them and only last maybe 3 reams of paper 1,500 to 2,000 pages for light mixed color and black-and-white business printing in my experience. This is up to the Brother advertised specification or better.The tn-315 high capacity toners say they give 6,000 USA letter pages black-and-white mono printing and I got that plus 15% using the mono (black and white) print mode with toner-save on about 1/2 the time it seems (I didn't count). On color they say 3,500 USA color letter pages and I got about 50% more than that when printing web pages without pictures but with color lettering WHILE USING ALSO the color toner save mode for about 80% of the prints.If you are using the toner-save mode you will get feeling that the print quality of this printer is poor but go back to the normal coverage mode and it looks very good again.So Brother's numbers are reasonable for average internet printing. Thank you Brother for the honesty and the fortunate fact your testing well fits my experience. Brother says they used the standard rotation of 5 standard color pages or one black and white standard page as per the ISO/IEC 19798 technical spec and this was reasonably accurate in my experience of toner usage . The old standard commonly used by printer makers before people used the internet was 5% coverage per page and was reasonably accurate for me who did mostly letters and not images. I don't know the % per page for this new specification but it does include quite a few images on the five test pages used.The ""toner save mode"", under Printer Settings - Advanced, as I've said, will save some toner though I use ""improve grey"" on both mono and Color Settings to make it look a little better because: some lettering can look unreadable if the website or pdf has already lightened the brightness for ink jet users and if they used a dot matrix type lettering it will not be a smooth and continuous lettering but looks like a dot matrix; these two problems together make the lettering look like it is faded out and it is just not good enough for regular reading. Thus some text pages printed using toner save will have to be reprinted for reading. The ""improve grey"" seems to help the lettering but I have not finished my study of this and other option setting yet.When you do print a full page of picture image color, even like the hp-4500-laserjet, it will really use up a LOT of toner. Since the toner life estimations are like for printing a 5 to 10% page coverage. So if you cover 100% of the page you will get maybe 5% to 10% of the cartridge life. Thus toner life will drop from 1,500 pages for the low capacity cartridges to 75 to 150 pages of full page color printing according to my rough estimate. So I use the toner save mode on color and black-&-white images for brochures which use a lot of color and pictures. Sometimes this is good enough and sometimes not for reading. Most web pages don't have a full page 100% image but include text that doesn't take much toner to print.Strategy:Some people could use a tn-315 high capacity cartridge for black-&-white and buy color cartridges with low capacity tn-310's if they print little color and use the toner save mode.Save each mode (color or mono) and print quality option combinations that you use as a slightly different ""preset"" name. Then you can quickly switch printer setups by selecting the different preset when you print. It is easier to do than explain.Duplex:You will love double sided pages since it saves a lot of paper and makes a less heavy load to carry when printing out longer documents especially with 20lb paper. I can't live without double-sided (duplexing) anymore.Quality:Its image quality sharpness and color range on the printed white page are not as good as the hp-4500-laserjet but it is fine if you will take like a 10-to-15% drop in overall quality. Not a great art printer but not the worst either if you put it on Color Settings for vivid color. Also try Printer Settings - Advanced - Improve print output - improve toner fixing.With some print-option experimenting and good paper it is fine for color quality just a little under the old HP standard which was quite high for a business printer. If a great art inkjet printer using more than three color inks gives A+ quality, and the old HP-4500-laserjet is a B+ quality for color prints using 3 color inks, then this is a C++ or B- for color prints.  Fine for off-the-internet pictures and such research. Much better than my parent's ink jet that runs out of ink all the time. If you go in and play with the settings and use a photo type laser paper you can get decent prints for any low to mid and some higher quality digital cameras as someone remarked in another review.HP no longer has a laser at this price point that reviews well. Brother in my experience is the best maker for the low cost equipment where you pay just slightly more and it works much better. This is what I call light-weight-industrial-equipment because though it is built in a light weight fashion it will turn out some high counts and quality dependably. The old HP-4500 was medium-weight-industrial quality and it cost more (and was made by Cannon for HP).3rd Party Toner Cartridges Are Like The Wild West... dangerous.When trying 3rd party ink from Abacus I had to do four 1 hour cleanups of inside toner sticky that got on rollers and everything else. This leaking toner caused almost every double-sided-page to bend the front corner edge on one side or both. Occasionally, pages started jamming, that is turning sideways and stopping the printer. Also a magenta, cyan, or yellow stripe or roundish splotches went down the edge of the page from the leaking toner. The main problem was leaking not the toner color itself which I liked a lot having a nice aliveness to it. But now I use the standard Brother cartridges not replacements.Toner does not leak when putting the cartridge in or taking it out. It leaks when the machine turns the roller that is built into the cartridge and then the toner pours out everywhere! Even from printing one page sometimes! Abacus was great giving my money back - thank you Abacus supplier! After 3 weeks with a broken printer due to leaking toner, are we not in love?  Due to a refund!So I went back to standard Brother toner cartridges which now work fine.The machine quit jamming and the edges quit bending but only after:a complete cleaning of all rollers especially the sides of the rollers that picked up the leaking toner most. To clean the image roller drums mounted under the toner cartridges I removed the toner cartridge tray from the machine. The removal system makes you play with a lever stop-arm that blocks the tray from falling out. Hire a monkey to do this it is too strange for the human mind. Putting it back in is still stranger - hold the stop-arm up, slide the tray in just the right amount of distance, then drop the stop-arm again to let the tray go the rest of the way in. You see even in Asia they want cheaper labor so they hired an alien, one of those childish grays I'm sure, to design this. Well it does work...Then I removed the toner cartridges from the tray. Then I used a paper towel and warm water and tried some water-ammonia spray then got scared and quit using it. The image-roller-drums about 3/4"" in diameter, four of them, one for each toner, must be clean ALL THE WAY ACROSS even where the paper doesn't touch at the left and right edges for about 1/2"" area to the end of the drums. I thought probably I had ruined the image drums but after printing a few pages they started producing good prints again.IF A PAPER EDGE EVER BENDS OVER AGAIN: pull the toner tray out and clean the left and right edges of the rollers again with warm water on a paper towel then dry it (since the roller end can get sticky even though you don't see excess toner on it and the stickiness will grab the paper at the edge and bend the edge over especially with todays ultralight 20 lb papers).After cleaning I have gone through about 5 reams (2,500 pages) with only one edge bent; I cleaned it again and have not had another in 4 reams (2,000 pages) and hope will have no more. I would say the printer does NOT have paper edge bend problems unless it leaks toner and then it is fixable without much trouble. Contrast this with my HP4500 that got an unfixable jamming problem.When you buy a new drum tray someday this problem will quit for a while or forever probably if you use good toner. This is NOT a Brother suggested service procedure but I was desperate with my image drums putting color casts like clouds in various places on the paper. I also vacuumed it everywhere I could get a vacuum's nozzle.TRUST:The leaking made me distrust the machine for a while but after cleaning of the drum edges that are below the toner cartridges on the drum/toner tray it began working fine again and quit bending page ends and quit jamming. What a scare!Trays:The fold out manual paper feed tray is a mystery seeming to print on one side of a paper one time and the other side of the paper the next time so I have not figured it out even after numerous trys. I've done some envelopes with it one-at-a-time through the manual tray but doing so is a black art worse than rocket science between the software and printer options that need sorting out. You will loose some envelopes to the learning process and seemingly unexplainable variations that the software-hardware throw at you. If I was married I would assign this job to my wife and let her boast when she figured it out. Sometimes it pays to be humble.Both the bottom and top tray work fine without jamming and they need to be selected by the printer driver settings. FOR THE MANUAL LOAD TRAY: Figuring out what is the top and bottom and front and end of the paper is confusing and I still put the paper in wrong sometimes. Just play with the manual tray for a while like a cat does with a ball of string and you will figure it out. Good luck!Yes eventually it will work predictably and you will have presets that you like. Don't have a drink of go-juice before doing it; the wayfaring mind suspended in alcohol will have a hard going and might push the printer off its table top in frustration.Hope you are bored of reading since I am burned out on writing.Good day!7-27-2012 UPDATE: Print drum carrier life. Replacement or not.Great news: After 25,000 + pages, half of them color, half black-&-white, the drum unit says to replace BUT it does NOT force you to replace it! So apparently they let you keep printing until you decide the printing detail is below your standards. This is a GREAT feature since the drum gradually goes bad thus it is a judgment call as to when to replace it. My old HP would go about 15 to 50 percent longer until it was printing bad prints. A bad print is not a messy smear but instead more like a 1/32"" line might be 2/32"" in size causing a loss of picture detail and ""fat"" lettering.10-5-2012 Update: Bent Paper Edges & How to fix them.Started getting bent edges on right-side-leading-edge of pages again. After cleaning of image drum rollers and the belt unit it still was doing it. Finally I found that some magenta had leaked and gotten into the Fuser unit (see page 154 of the Main Users Guide for pictures). The fuser is accessed at the back cover of the unit. You pull the back over down then follow directions to flip down some small outer rollers to expose the HOT fuser rollers, two of them, lower bright orange roller and upper dark black roller. The upper one seems most hot. I turned the unit off to let it cool. The magenta toner had hardened on the upper scraping edge next to the darker fuser roller. I used a suede brush with its hard bristles and and exacto knife to loose the hardened toner that was bending the edge of the page as it came through the fuser rollers. I cleaned some toner off the lower orange fuser roller also with a paper towel. Last I blew it out with compressed air. Now I have no bent edges on the paper. Back to near perfection.7-2013 Update: Belt Unit lifeAfter about 40,000 pages the machine said to replace the ""Belt Unit"", but does Not force you to do so. This belt transfers the pages from the center inside of the printer up to the exit of the unit. When it gets old and slippery it spits pages out the front of the machine just above the upper print tray but only on long print runs as the belt gets warm. On short runs it works just fine. The fix of course is a new ""Belt Unit"". At 40k pages I guess this is ok economics. I'm keeping the old unit for a while since it still works except on long runs when temperatures rise.Update: 7-2013 Toner use.This is a good printer I'm liking it so far, 40,000 prints into its life. I do most prints on ""Print Settings"" ""advanced"" ""toner save mode"" and it really helps save toner - seems to last twice as long. On purposely dimmed lettering made for ink-jet use you need to avoid the ""toner save mode"" or it will get too light to read.  Just do a normal print and the light lettering built into the page will save the toner for you.Printer Printing Statistics:On the printer's LCD panel & control buttons, use the ""print settings"" to get a three page printout of printer usage information, and the remaining life of the replaceable internal parts including toner. The IP address is also there on page three, so you can use your browser to find the printer's control page with statistics, over your household internet. See in the Users Guide ""How to use Web Based Management"". This only works on the ethernet connected printers.

We tested these on a variety of surfaces & printers - here are our results:* Adhesion: They stick great to a variety of surfaces: thin file folders, thick file folders, cardboard boxes, regular copy paper, books, plastic (i.e., shrink wrapped items & blister packs). Same results each time - great adhesion.* Temperature: We tried these in warm (80F) and cold (20F). They do exceptionally well in the cold - even standard packing tape has problems in 20, but these adhere pretty well. They do not fall off easily.* Moisture: They even hold up well when slightly damp, or exposed to slight humidity. Unfortunately there is no way to report any ""long term"" testing at this time (i.e., if your records storage is not climate controlled - but I have no reason to suspect any problems).* Removability: Yes, great. They peel cleanly off any surface.* Re-usable: Yes! If using on cardboard, they can peel & re-use 3 or 4 times. If using on file folders, or a smoother surface (blister packs, glossy book covers, etc), even more. Adhesion is great.* Printer Jams: OOPS! ... near fatal flaw here for most people. Tested in 5 machines - jammed at least once in every machine. It jams in our laser printer & laser copier 25% of the time. It jammed in our ink jet printer once or twice.The problem is that these are slightly wider than 8.5"" (actually about 8 and 7/16""). They don't feed in our plain paper copier/fax machine AT ALL - the paper width cannot be adjusted, and it simply wont grab the sheet. And, when combined with regular copy paper, it jams nearly 100% of the time.WHEN PRINTING: Make sure the paper width in your printer can adjust slightly, and make sure not to mix them with other types of paper. Also, it tends to feed better through printers (like our ink jet) that ""straight"" feed (as opposed to laser printers which feed paper through an S-shaped drum).* Re-feeding through printer: Here's another potential problem. They work best in only one direction. It's not designed to print 10 labels, turn it over, and print 10 different labels at some point in the future. That will waste labels for some people, who don't need to print 30 labels at a time. Also, if you try to feed it through a laser printer more than once, the edges will start peeling (due to the heat I suppose, which is not an issue with ink jet printers).* Laser vs Ink Jet: When they did feed properly, the resolution was great on both types of printer.* Cross-comparison: We compared these to 3M, HP, Avery, Office Depot Brand, and Office Max brand removable labels. They rank BEST for adhesion, temperature, removability, and re-usability...but *WORST* for printer jamming.* Conclusion: They are excellent in every way except for the occasional printer jam.",3,"We put these through a variety of tests - they work great for us, but design flaw may cause printer jamming",1261785600,"12 26, 2009",502,31,32,0.96875,helpful

Unless you're sending off a document to someone who is actually going to stare down your fonts, the quality is great for home and small to medium business users.The OS X installation was totally idiot-proof. Pop in the disc, hit ""install"", and reboot. When connected to a network, the printer automatically appears and sets itself up. There is a Canon Network Scan Utility that gets installed and resides in the toolbar, which is no more intrusive than the volume or Airport icons.As far as the driver itself goes, duplex printing and other options work flawlessly in any OS X application.The network scanning is a real pleasure to use. If you share this across multiple computers (Mac or Windows), you can pick a destination computer from a list on the LCD, drop your documents in to the autofeeder, and wait for everything to get kicked out to your computer as a PDF (or JPEG).The integrated card readers are also great. If you insert a card in to one of the slots, the printer appears as a CIFS file share (so it will show up in My Network Places on Windows or Shared in the OS X Finder) that anybody can browse to.To top it all off, the replacement ink is reasonably priced (and just about ""cheap"" if you buy multipacks on Amazon) and easy to find at any major retailer (if you can't wait for Amazon to ship).I'd buy this printer again in a heartbeat.",5,"Great quality, and outstanding Mac support!",1217462400,"07 31, 2008",312,11,12,0.916666667,helpful

Look and feel of the base and the portables is exceptional. It is very appealing to the eye.b) Sound quality is very good. Tends to be a bit over driven, but easily adjusted by turning down the volume. Volume range is also very good.c) Speaker phone function at each station is a great feature.d) Useful range is phenominal compared to my prior Panasonic 5.8 multi-line system.e) Backlighting on handsets and the base is excellent.f) Clock on screen of handsets is an excellent size when these stations are sitting idle.g) One phonebook and one call history list! They are stored in the base station and shared by all the portable phones. Any station can add entries to the phonebook. (Note: any station can also delete entries, so there needs to be some ground rules with your family or small office as to who is the decision maker for edits.)h) Clock and date seem to be updated  by the land line system.What I don't like:a) Wallpaper images are limited from the manufacturer and cannot be altered. There are only 4 out of the box options.c) Ring tones are set by the manufacturer. No user upgrade option. There are a number of choices, which is good.d) Since the phonebook is stored in the base and shared by all the stations, only one station has access at a time. Not a huge issue but can be frustrating while waiting to gain access.Some folks have commented that the response time on the base dial pad is a little slow. Well, yeah maybe, but only 1 or 2 seconds, and if that is a big deal to you, you must be too busy and impatient....take a chill pill!

I needed a printer to print the plans at home. It may be a photographic quality printer, I don't know. I only used it for home plans. I didn't really need color, but it come with color and the color works fine.Arriving:The first surprise was the overall size. It was way bigger than I thought it would be. UPS doesn't just dump it on your porch. A mover comes to your house and asks you, ""where do you want us to put it?"" You need to have enough room for it. It won't just fit on your desk, I think you have to get the stand. Once I saw how big it was, I ordered a stand. That wasted about a week. Finally, I got the stand put together and the printer put on it. Set up was not to bad, but I paid a computer expert to hook it up. I don't know how much trouble I would have had if I did it myself. I found later that the OfficeMax had one in the printing department, if you want to go see one. I imagine they all have the same stuff.Use;The only thing bad, I found so far, (about a month), is it is hard to change the paper. It is hard to get the paper in straight. It takes the machine about 2 or 3 minutes to figure out if it will accept the paper or not. Four or five tries will take 15 minutes. This is not good if you are printing at the last minute. My advice is buy the HP paper. The edges are taped, not glued. You can untape it with out damaging the leading edge of the paper and then the paper will feed in the first time.  I looked for a YOUTube video on the feeding of the paper. I found videos of printing, but no set up or paper feeding. If you make it as far printing as the fellow in the video, you would have mastered the machine with no video.Canon;I don't know if they read this, but if they do, they should post some videos online. It would make it easier to operate. Seems like they don't care. The machine is nice, but where are their engineers? The Canon web site is lacking also. If you enter the ink cartridge number you need in the search area in the Canon site, it says ""not found"". How can they not have all their own numbers in their own site? Finding ink (on this size printer, they call it ink, not toner) may be a challenge. I could not find the exact same cartridges that came with the printer on Amazon. Like I said before, I could not find them on the Canon site either. I ordered several kinds of ink cartridges (on Amazon) to see which ones would work. It seems like Canon would care more than that.Bottom Line;This is way better than not having a 24 x 36 printer. I was driving all over town and not getting plans printed on time was a major delay for me. Now I can print at home. I don't have a handle on cost yet. but it pays for itself in time saved. I would buy it again, but I wish the Canon people had some common sense, as far as making operation user friendly. I don't want to be negative. I am really happy with this purchase. As you can see by the 5 stars. There was nothing affordable even 2 years ago. Hope this was helpful.",5,Printer,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",620,18,19,0.947368421,helpful

This pen actually meets and exceeds my expectations in every respect.The pen is an excellent writer with a flexible enough nib to produce very nice letters, and even allows me to open up some of the loops with my rather small hand writing.  Of course, using a fountain pen competently requires one to slow down and write with care and deliberation.  The Carene is no exception.  One must be attentive, but the result is generally better penmanship.As with all of my other Waterman fountain pens, I employ the converter and use only Waterman's blue-black ink. The combination of ink and fine nib is excellent on most stationary, writing tablets, and even my generally too smooth journal pages.The pen is aesthetically wonderful. I prefer the Waterman Charleston's lines more, but this pen is still gorgeous, and I think the amber shimmer is the best design. I've also seen other color schemes for this pen and I think they are all attractive. This is a marriage of beauty and excellent design that creates a fountain pen masterpiece.The design incorporates a bit more weight than I had thought it would, but the pen is superbly balanced and a pleasure to write with for extended periods of time.  In fact, I wish I could write this review using the Carene rather than this keyboard.A word about the price and delivery of this product.

I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to crop photos directly from the printer and using the other printer options but that could be user error since digital is so new to me.However, I find the instructions not very detailed or indepth as to all the options the printer offers. The directions are easy to understand for what it shows you, just doesn't explain everthing the printer was said to offer. Ex... fully explains how to print from the memory card but does not give the same explaination of how to print directly from the camera. But, I'll keep working on that! Thank you!",4,I believe I made an excellent choice!,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",179,10,10,1,helpful
83942,A2IY49V4ARN4HC,B00006LLHW,K. Parry,"[66, 67]","The main reason my husband and I got this phone was to replace our Panasonic 2.4 GhZ phone, which seemed to drain battery life very quickly.  The store I bought this from had a few different 5.8 options to choose from, and this seemed like we would get the most bang for our buck.Unfortunately the day after we bought this, the handset died, and we could not fix it.  We took it back to the store, and we were able to exchange it with no problems.  This one has been working ever since- about 3 weeks.I'm not sure why some reviewers are complaining about no speed dial.  I programmed 43 different numbers in the phone, and have room to spare for new ones! Actually, the memory is very similar to a cell phone's memory- you search for the number by name rather than dialing *2 or such.  And the capability of holding in memory so many recently dialed and recently received numbers is very helpful as well.  My only complaint in this department is if the number is from a different area code, the caller ID does not show the 1 first, so rather than just hitting redial you have to write down the number, then dial the 1 plus the number.  But I'm not sure if this is a problem with the phone or our phone company's caller ID system.I do find that the battery life on this phone isn't exactly the greatest, but the handset always shows the time with a cute little clock on the screen, which I suppose drains the battery.  I have also found that using the speaker function on the handset, while a VERY helpful feature (especially when changing my daughter's diaper!), drains the battery extremely quickly, so this should only be used occasionally.  But this phone also supports additional handsets (up to 5) so you can purchase extra handsets to avoid having to wait around for it to charge.Major plus points:- The phone includes a handsfree earset, and a clip, so you can use this while walking around the house, and your neck doesn't get that annoying phone cramp.- The speaker function on both the base and the handset- The ability to transfer the call from phone to phone or from phone to base.- The sound quality is excellent on the handset- The high memory capability (I remember the days of only being able to store 10 numbers in a phone.  I don't know very many people, but I certainly need more than 10 numbers in the speed dial!), both to record numbers in the phone book, and to redial previously dialed or previously received calls- The blue light that lights up on the base when the phone is in use- I have accidentally left my previous handsets on, and drained the battery before I realized this.  This light helps prevent that- The extra battery storage, so you can have an extra battery charged at all times, either to put in the handset, or to still be able to use the phone during a power outage.  Very cool!- The answering system includes 3 mail boxes, for different members of the family, which I imagine would be highly helpful for those families with teenagers in the house, so you don't have to listen to their messages to get to yours and vice versa.  I personally don't need this feature yet, but it's a great addition.Complaints:- The phone does not include a second handset in the package.  Most of the new phones I've seen that support extra handsets include at least two handsets in the package!- Extra handsets are still quite expensive- about half the cost of the entire phone and base.- There seems to be a problem with the volume on the answering machine: the volume of the announcer (ie ""you have two new messages"") is very loud, while the actual message records very quietly; so the announcer blasts, while you have to strain to hear the message.- Battery life could be improved- I find myself having to charge the phone about every 2-3 days- The volume adjustment on the handset is placed in a position where it is very easy to change the volume several times during a conversation.- Although it is neat to have different ring tones on the phone, the different ringers seem to be from circa 1998 cell phones- I'm sure they could have gotten more creative than this! They all pretty much sound the same to me.As you can see the pros far outweigh the cons on this phone.  If you really need several handsets, I don't necessarily recommend buying this system because of the high cost of the extra handsets.  If anyone at AT&T; of influence is reading this, please, PLEASE try to find a way to lower the cost of the additional handsets!  Otherwise this is a great phone with great sound quality, and I've found it to be a great improvement over the 2.4 GhZ models.",4,"Good phone, minor complaints",1052524800,"05 10, 2003",830,66,67,0.985074627,helpful

303430,A2V7A7W8FFVD8F,B000QXAU8I,P. Allen,"[62, 62]","I have owned this phone for about 3 weeks now, and my review is based on my experience with it in that time.First off, the setup was a snap.  It took less than five minutes to get the phone up and running (and perhaps another 20 to complete the optional firmware update).  Setup consists of connecting the base station to your internet router and to an electrical outlet, then configuring the hand unit for your Skype account.  Additional tinkering was necessary to customize the features to my liking, but I found the interface fairly user friendly and this process was also easy.While user friendly, the interface is definitely the weakest aspect of the phone.  It is slow and a bit clunky.  There are noticeable pauses while switching between screens and especially when scrolling through contacts.  The refresh rate on the color LCD screen is slow enough that when it scrolls a long contact name across the screen, the letters become significantly blurred and almost impossible to read.  Additionally, it requires several clicks to view missed calls and access voicemails (e.g. Menu -> History -> Voicemail -> Options -> Play).The most annoying behavior occurs during a phone call.  First and foremost, the phone stops displaying the battery indicator during calls, so you have no idea how much talk time you have left.  Second, the backlight on the screen turns off after a minute or so to conserve power, but there is no way to turn it back on without pressing a button on the phone, and there are no buttons which don't automatically perform some function (place the call on hold, hang up, etc...).  This would be a bigger annoyance if the phone were actually displaying useful information during the call.Despite these shortcomings, the phone does work well.  Sound quality is acceptable.  Battery life is also decent, perhaps 2-3 hours of talk time, 1-2 days standby.  I love that you can easily swap out the standard AAA batteries, unlike most cordless phones which can only charge on their base station.  The AAA batteries do charge inside the phone while it's connected to the charging station (NiMH rechargeables only).Ergonomically, the phone is fairly comfortable for extended use.  It fits well to my face, though the edges at the top are slightly sharp and can get uncomfortable after a while as they dig into my ear.  Volume is sufficient and can be controlled using the up and down arrows on the key pad.  The speakerphone is not quite loud enough sometimes, but generally gets the job done.Integration with the Skype service is nearly perfect, and you really can't beat the cost of their Skype Pro service (even with SkypeIn, it's 90% cheaper than comparable service through my local phone company).  In comparison to Vonage and other VoIP services I have used, the reliability, call quality and easy of use is far superior with this phone and Skype (not to mention a fraction of the cost).All-in-all this is a good phone with a few annoying design flaws.  The overriding selling point is certainly its compatibility with the wonderful Skype network.  I would recommend it at least until a more streamlined version is released.Update - 4/4/2008:After a few months of usage, I'm still very happy with this phone.  I haven't discovered any new problems beyond the ones I originally outlined in my review.  Having had time to get used to all the interface quirks, I'd say that my only standing complaint is the sound quality.  It's just not as clear as Skype through a computer, or even my cell phone.  It seems like they could fix this with a better quality speaker.Reliability has been extremely good in comparison to Vonage and even our land-based carrier.  I haven't yet experienced a service outage or dropped call that wasn't the result of my cable internet going down, nor have I experienced any of the lock-ups that another reviewer mentioned.Overall, I'm still very pleased with the phone.  I will leave it at 4 stars due to the quirky interface and sub-par sound quality.",4,"Good phone, great service, but a few quirks",1202169600,"02 5, 2008",675,62,62,1,helpful
1214497,A3ELOCDHFEPEKJ,B00EU9V5EM,Angie Boyter,"[96, 102]","Design: The printer is nice and compact, slightly over 7 inches tall, about 13 inches deep, and 15 inches wide.  The paper tray, like several other Epson printers I have used, is smaller than the trays in printers from HP, which is a nuisance---printing remotely does not work well if the paper tray is empty. When you print, the touchscreen panel opens up and a tray comes out of the front of the printer for the output. This is a nice improvement over my last Epson Artisan printer, which tended to eject printouts onto the floor, but the tray and the panel must then be closed manually, which is a bit inelegant. The ink cartridges are physically smaller than normal, and I will be interested to see how long they last. Two black cartridges are used at one time plus a photo black cartridge. There are two paper cassettes, one for standard-sized paper and one for smaller sizes such as typical photo-sized paper. CAUTION: Without asking, the installation defaults to the small cassette when you print photos; you might or might not want that setting.Installation: I got ink on my hands from installing several of the cartridges, which has never happened to me with other cartridges. The wi-fi  automatic setup failed, so I had the opportunity to try out the setup wizard. It worked well and was easy to use.Operation: Printing worked well (once I had reset my defaults to the size and type of paper I was using. It is also important to make sure you have designated the right kind of paper, glossy or standard.). The print was sharp, and the colors were true. When I copied, however, there was some degradation of colored items and some loss of small details of patterns. On copies, purples tended to pick up some brown tones, and pinkish reds came out with more orange.Special Features: The Epson Connect feature allows a user to print remotely from another device that has e-mail capability simply by sending an e-mail to the printer's e-mail address. I tried this feature, and it  worked nicely.However, the widely touted ability to print from an Android phone is not satisfactory. It was easy to download and install the Epson iPrint app from Google Play (Yes, you DO use iPrint; it is not just for Apple products despite the name.). There is also an Epson Creative Print app that lets you do fanciful things like turn your photos into black-and-white ""coloring books"" for your kids (or you) to play with.  From the iPrint app it is straightforward to print your photos. However, if you want to print other kinds of files from your phone, you must go to Saved Documents on the iPrint menu and access the file structure of the phone. This does not work well.  I was never able to find, for example, my calendar entries or my contacts from the app. It is not possible to be looking at your calendar or an S Notes document like my Grocery List and print it out directly from that screen.  The Epson tech rep told me this is a Samsung issue, not an Epson issue. This may be true, but nonetheless I think their claims about printing from my smartphone are a bit overstated.Support: Finding a phone number is not easy. It is in the Quick Start Guide and at the back of the online Owners Guide. Otherwise, you are stuck using e-mail; there is no online chat. The tech rep was able to answer my questions about using the Epson iPrint app to print from my phone.Summary: For normal home use, the nicely compact Epson XP-810 is reasonably satisfactory, but the special features are not as good as I had hoped, and a larger paper tray would be a big improvement. Since the ""bells and whistles"" were disappointing, I wonder if I could have done as well with a simpler printer.UPDATE: I downgraded this rating to a 2 based on my experience with the print cartridges and am sufficiently unhappy that I am in the market for a new printer. I do not do high-volume printing and would estimate I average no more than 25 pages a week, practically all in black and white except for an occasional blue hypertext link. My black cartridge ran dry in 6 weeks, despite extending it. I am into the third week of my second cartridge, and the level shows it half gone. All of the color cartridges are also dry. I bought brand-new Epson cartridges and had two bad experiences replacing them that I have never encountered before: The blue cartridge spattered all over when I removed it (despite the fact that it was supposed to be completely empty), and the magenta cartridge had leaked all over its sealed envelope, which required me to go back to Staples and exchange it. Obviously the cost per page for this printer is high; the quality control is questionable; and it is messy to change the cartridges.",2,Print cartridges highly unsatisfactory,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",834,96,102,0.941176471,helpful

As usual, with no new driver, another perfectly fine and useful scanner dies due to an operating system upgrade. As my scanning at present is more document based, I decided to try this less expensive option and give Canon a chance.On first glance, it seems my research has paid off. This scanner was quick and easy to install out of the box. The directions were straightforward and useful. One is first instructed to run the setup CD, then remove and unlock the scanner, and finally to plug in the USB. I did not have the problem of the second reviewer: my lock button was in the lock position when I received it, and was even taped over for security.The scanner has a small footprint and sleek style, compared to my previous model.The software is easy to use, although it sometimes seems that too many screens are involved. I believe there are options to streamline this to some extent.My first function was a one-button copy. My sheet music copied as well as the average commercial copier. (Quality was also much better than a B & W  copy on my Epson Stylus CX4800 all-in-one.) The pencil marks, however, were very light on the copy, and barely readable. Original highlighting on the piece was gone.I then performed a one-button scan of the same music. It took about 16 seconds, including software linking. This time the music detail was also excellent and pencil marks were very readable. After the scan, I sent it to the printer where the music quality remained, pencil marking remained strong, and highlighting was preserved.One note regarding one-button functions: as the second reviewer noted, after choosing a one-button function a CanoScan-generated option list appears requiring the user to ""Select program to launch for this action"". On my computer there are four options, and I must choose MP Navigator EX from the list. I thought that after the first time I chose the launch program that it would be remembered. It wasn't, so I searched every screen and the user guide, and have not found a way to alter this. It is a definite nuisance that I hope Canon will fix with an update soon.When scanning, one must place the object upside down on platen to receive a vertical product. In general, the platen is roomy, allowing all but about 1mm on each side left to right of useable space. From cursory scans, it appears there is very little surface area that will not be useable on this scanner (unlike my Epson), which equates to less fidgeting with the original on placement.Unlike the previous reviewer, once I changed my default file location for saves, all my auto scans saved to that location.I also haven't found the buttons to be hard to press, or to move the scanner (I have a glass desktop). I do find that after you press the button there is a small lag time before the scan operation begins, so it's easy to think you didn't really press it hard enough.There is no light on the scanner, as it is always on when the computer is, since it is powered by the USB, not a power cord.I scanned an 8x10 professional color portrait on auto scan, with the following results:- it saved to my correct location, with a subfolder created by current date (a changeable option)- the end file size was 1533 kb (auto mode scans at 300 dpi)- only 1-2 mm of the photo was cut off by auto cropping...a very acceptable result- the detail and quality seemed excellent on the screenIn general, cropping has been very precise on photos and documents.I did scan a book to test the shadow reduction feature and was disappointed. Not only was there still a shadow, but the text was unreadable at the center. I did successive scans, pressing harder on the spine first with the scanner lid, and then under the lid with my hand, with little overall improvement. Later, I found on option in the software to ""turn on"" the shadow adjustment, so I tried the scan again with no improvement. Perhaps there is more to be discovered still with the software to implement this feature properly...As I haven't had a new scanner for a number of years, I decided to try the OCR function, hoping that perhaps the industry had made strides in this regard. It was sorely lacking, making profuse spelling errors, handling italics and small caps fonts poorly. Overall, still a dysfunctional function.My one pause for concern that caused me to give this scanner only four stars is a glitch that occurred with the scanner's hardware interface. After successfully scanning for 1-2 hours straight without any system flaws, I left the computer for an hour or so. Upon coming back and trying a one-button function I received a ScanGear Error: ""Cannot communicate with scanner, Cable may be disconnected or scanner may be turned off. Check status, scanner driver will be closed."" I closed and reopened software, and restarted the computer. No improvement. The scanner did not show up on Device Manager. Finally I removed and replaced the USB connection to the computer and the scanner was again recognized. There was no function made by a user; however, perhaps a screen saver coming on or the computer going into sleep mode may have initiated this error. I am hoping this is not a repetitive problem.I waited several weeks to purchase this scanner, and the first review was slow to come. I finally decided to purchase and provide a review for others--a risk these days, especially with Vista 64. Overall, I think this will be a good product.

977853,AOOS9WXCDPC5Y,B0063B8B92,Robert Haven,"[8, 10]","This printer is a 5-star value within its category of inexpensive printers.  It is so impressive how much functionality is offered at this price. I've been using a similarly-priced Canon all-in-one wireless printer and was happy with it, but this Epson is faster, has more features (double-sided printing for one), and has far better on-printer controls and displays.  My needs are those of a light-duty home office printer, where I print or copy a few pages a day, and the printer meets all my needs.Setup was easy.  After I powered it up the first time, it found my existing wireless network and I simply entered the WEP password via the front panel display and keypad. No need to hook up USB cables for setup.  You need to install the Epson driver software (from the provided CD or by downloading it) onto each computer from which you want to use the printer and this is straightforward and takes about 15 minutes per computer.  After completing the first driver installation on my first computer, the driver informed me it was downloading and installing new printer firmware onto the printer, and that took about 10 minutes but completed without any glitches.  What I don't understand is why, when installing the driver on additional computers in my home, it repeated this lengthy firmware download and install when it was already done the first time.  Oh well.I haven't printed any photos, so I can't comment on that, but I've printed a lot of b/w and color pages and made some copies (using the enlarging feature) and have no negative things to say about the printer.  Things I like: 1) the blank paper lies flat in a tray (rather than curling up in a vertical paper feed like on my Canon);  2) the 3"" color LCD display and keypad enables lots of easy-to-use control right on the printer; 3) text pages are printed quickly, taking about 4 seconds to print a pageful of b/w text; 4) three separate color ink cartridges (plus a black cartridge) should be more economical especially if you tend to print a lot of one color.Another reviewer complained about cheap plastic, and yeah there's a lot of lightweight plastic but it makes no difference in the functionality and quality of the things that are important, and it keeps the device inexpensive.I'm very pleased with this printer and very impressed by all the functionality, speed, ease-of-use, and print quality.",5,Great functionality; great value,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",406,8,10,0.8,helpful

It's becoming a frequent event as a result of a car accident that originally screwed it up years ago. This most recent time, I have not been able to fully recover. I go back and forth between feeling relatively ok to having unbearable twinges and out and out constant pain in my lower back. I noted that the times when it was the worst were during long intervals at my desk in my very uncomfortable office chair. So began my quest for a more comfortable chair.I remembered that a while back I had seen these knee chairs and heard they were great for your back so I started researching them. After looking at a few here and reading the reviews I thought it best to head out to actually sit in some. The Healthy Back Store has several, including this one and the fact that at the store its about the same price as one here including shipping, I decided to get it there. I sat in 3 others and they each are bad to absolutely awful. This one, with the adjustable height of the seat at just past halfway, I am in a position of great comfort with my knees and shins not pressing all the way to the bottom of the generous memory foam pads as some have claimed and my butt is not uncomfortably put upon either. (My height is 5'-6"" and weight is about 130 lbs)The other chairs I tested are also sold here on amazon, including one with a pad for your back should you want the extra support that can provide. In that model's case, the point where you would find a semi comfortable position in the seat bottom put u in an uncomfortable one when utilizing the back pad. Also, the fabric on that model was a coarse heavy coarse tweed which already from just a few minutes sitting in it was leaving an uncomfortable embossed impression in my knees and shins and started to itch my skin in those areas.The other chairs suffered from lack of adjustability making it impossible to get the seat into the proper angled alignment beneficial for my back. My back felt WORSE in those chairs.Now back to this chair. It has very comfortable fabric, a wider range of adjustability and is made of what feels like sturdier steel and the pads really are actual memory foam, and they feel like a more substantial variety of it than the other chairs which have half the padding thickness of this chair.This chair is a bargain as well. Those other chairs cost as much as 100 bucks more than this one.Test them all out like I did to be sure as different height and weight people may find other attributes to like about other chairs, but for me, this is definitely the best one I found. I hope I have years of comfort in it. My back sure doesn't hurt at all anymore from sitting, so mission accomplished.",5,superb sitting,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",517,19,21,0.904761905,helpful
338053,AEY8A9VS22BV4,B000W2KUHE,"Charles Johnston ""Candy Perfume Boy""","[28, 28]","Been using Skype on my Windows 7 (64 bit) laptop quite happily for a few months now. My only concern after those months was being physically 'tied to the computer' to be able to 'use my phone' (Skype is my only telephone service of any kind) So the search for a cordless phone began. This 3J-W1D cordless Skype USB phone fills my needs 100%. The included software installed effortlessly and afterwards a system reboot got Skype and SkypeMate (the phone's software client)in sync and I was immediately able to call people from wherever in my home I desired. I need to clarify an erroneous review here. This phone DOES come with a battery that is shipped inside the same packing sleeve the phone comes in but not obviously so. Hence I suspect the other reviewer probably threw his battery out with the rest of the packaging. Anyway if you look closely it is impossible NOT to see the battery tucked in it's own little cardboard 'doghouse' formed within the phone's own cardboard packing sleeve. The batery is white and only about the size of 2 USA first class postage stamps placed side-by-side. It thickness is about a 1/4"" at the moct. The attached wiring (which one needs to plug into the phone) is so very tiny. My fat 59 yr old fingers were able to do it. I suggest you enlist the help of a child to avoid stress and swear words!  Anyway the phone works fine it duplicates the contacts list from your pc-based Skype program. I have yet to test the advertised 160 ft range but since it is adequate for me at home (about 50 ft max)I am pleased. Maybe some sunny morning (or starry night) I'll stroll out onto the veranda and call someone. BTW here is a link to the owner's manual (pdf) should you like to see that pre-sale. [...]The phone is entirely powered from any available USB port. My battery was partially charged when I installed it and I was able to make some calls to test it for any issues. Once I placed it on the base (which includes a nice sounding speaker phone)it indicated it was charging for abour 3 hours (flashing led) then finally fully charged (steady led). The handset display is black and white with a very nice 'blue glow' background lighting. I find it easily readable  and quite attractive too. One pleasant surprise is the feel of the phone in your hand. It is about 3/4 scale size of a 'normal' landline cordless phone but the tactile response (what it feels like to the touch) is a smooth yet gently 'grippy' somewhat soft rubber-like texture. It feels great and is not likely to slip out of your hands easily.My only complaint is i have yet to see how to change the 24 hr format time to 12 hr am/pm format. It seems to mimick the installed Skype pc software which I don't think has an option or a Skype 'Extra' for this selection. I sent an email to the manufacturer in Gilbert,AZ about this but so far no replie. (How many times have we read similar words ..eh?) Here is the homepage for this phone's manufacturer  [...]  Lastly while on it's base the time is easily readable in about 3/4"" high bold black letters and beneath that in smaller text it says ""Let's Skype""  so it makes for a handy clock too depending where you place it and that is what led me to wanting to set it from 24 hr format to 12 hr am/pm. Right now it is 1:04 pm but my Skype phone says it is 13:04 and makes me feel I'm back in the Army again.I would HIGHLY recommend anyone looking for a realtively inexpensive Skype-based cordless USB-powered phone to try this one out.

Upon buying a new Mac Pro a week ago, Lion was forced upon me.  I purchased Photoshop CS5, but I had not upgraded my scanner from the CanoScan 8400f (SUPER workhorse scanner!).  The 8400f was dead in Lion as Canon no longer supports it with drivers/software.  Canon's website has a list of Lion compatible scanners.  I ordered a used 8600f off an auction website.  CS5 saw it BUT it was horribly slow and glitchy, crashing 2/3 scans.Apple's website has a list of Lion compatible scanners which does NOT include the 8600f.  The list only includes the 5600f and 9000f (and some Lide scanners).  The difference between Canon's website and Apple's is HUGE.

One of the pockets is situated on the BACK of the envelope and is not protected with the flap that seals the envelop shut.  So if you were thinking it would be a two pocket accordian style you are wrong.  Because the back has a &#34;stylish&#34; scoop, papers put in there won't be protected.

We were very happy to make a special calendar to give his Nana for X-mas.But there are 2 things I wasn't very happy about it that are actually related.When I ordered I thought that the calendar was inside the box all ready to use and all you have to do was draw or glue some pic or stickers at the top part of it. But NO with the kit it only comes with the papers for you draw or whatever and you want then you have to mail the papers to them or upload to their site to get the calendar made for you.That's my second problem with this kit even tough the envelope to return the pictures to them it has a free stamp on it they'll charge you $2.95 for S/H (more if extra calendars are ordered). Also it takes 3 weeks from when they receive plus 3 to 10 days for the delivery time. Of course the Rush delivery is available for a $12.95 still will take 3 weeks for them to get ready maybe even more time during X-mas time or the end of school year. So if you want this calendar for this X-mas or any special date that you need fast forget it.The good thing is you can order extra calendars with the same order for only $14.99 each( instead of $19.99)also have cool options like laminate,Print speacial notes at special dates, extra months, make it bigger etc...( all that at extra charge including printing special dates/each).Overall I think is a great item great to give as a gift or to make as a gift we have fun together and will give his Nana a special gift this X-mas (even it might get there late.

In the end, I decided to buy it directly from Neatco in case I ran into problems - I figured it would be easier to return it directly to the manufacturer than through some third party.The first problem is that it arrived without software, documentation, or the activation code.  Fortunately, one call to Neatco resolved that immediately as they emailed me the activation code with a link to download the software.So, I'm off and running, right?  Unfortunately, no.  It would shoot paper through the scanner and make all the expected noises, but I only got blank pages (aside: I liked the ""automatically remove blank page"" feature--too bad it was deleting ALL my pages).  I played around with the different scanning modes: single sided, duplex, auto blank page removal on/off, scanning from the scanner button, and scanning from the computer and it still didn't work.I reported the problem to Neatco's customer support system which was different - it's done via email instead of over the phone.  That presented some problems because Neatco is based on the east coast and works east coast hours while I live on the west coast and work west coast hours.  So by the time I got home from work, Neatco had shut down for the day.  So technical support consisted of me sending them an email describing the problem, waiting until I got home the next day to get their trouble shooting recommendations. When that didn't work, I'd respond with my results and wait another 24 hours before the next bit of advice arrived.Eventually they concluded that the scanner was bad and sent me a new one.

I was initially skeptical of purchasing the HP because I have had problems with other HP printers.  I also read reviews on other sites saying the printer was not fully compatible with Mac OX X Lion.  But I decided the feature set was too irresistible not to give it a try.I received the printer from Amazon quicker than I expected and was excited to set it up.  Unfortunately, the setup was a nightmare from the moment that I turned the printer on.  The printer has a really nice touchscreen but no physical buttons other than the power button.  When you plug in the printer, the first thing that the setup program prompts you for is a language.  I pushed what I was thought was English but apparently my finger actually activated another language nearby and from that point forward I could not read any of the setup screen prompts.  I fumbled through a few buttons that I thought might work, but finally the process ended in an error message in a foreign language that I couldn't exit out of.  I called tech support, who tried to help me do a factory reset, but they actually couldn't figure out how to make the printer return to factory settings!  Apparently previous models had a combination of key presses that could factory reset the machine, but the touchscreen makes this process more complicated.  There is supposed to be an area of the panel that you push four or five times to bring up a service menu, but my touchscreen was completely unresponsive.So, HP sent me a replacement.  I was much more careful to select the language that I was familiar with this time.  Setup went smoothly this time.  As instructed in the package insert for Mac users, I used the Software Update on the Mac to get the latest driver.  I was up and running quickly, printing both from my Mac and also my iPhone and iPad via AirPrint. Very nice.  This printer is fast and delivers high quality text and graphics.I wasn't totally out of the woods yet though--I tried to scan a document to pdf using the printer, and got an error message that my computer was not properly setup for this.  When I tried to follow the onscreen instructions, I kept getting error messages.  So back to HP tech support I went, this time with an online chat.  I was guided through an uninstall and reinstall of the HP utility, which worked flawlessly.  I am now able to scan to pdf from the printer, and it also has a really cool feature that lets you send an email directly from the printer with the scanned document attached.  I have read reviews on other sites that these scanner functions are not supported in Lion, but I can assure you that they are.  If you are having trouble I would recommend contacting HP for a walkthrough.All in all, excellent printer and would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the issues I had with setup and needing to get a replacement sent.  At less than $200 this is a lot of printer for the money.  It has a larger footprint than the laser that it is replacing, but it isn't grossly oversized and looks very nice on a desk.",4,"works well with Mac OS X Lion, after an initial hiccup",1323907200,"12 15, 2011",574,85,96,0.885416667,helpful

I already had an excellent Brother black and white laser printer and thought I would get rid of my HP 8500 which does not allow for printing with smart phones and tablets.  Therefore I decided to give the 4710 a chance.  This is an attractive ""small foot print"" printer which was easy to set up on a PC and a Mac.  No problems printing on regular paper--but trying to print photos was frustrating.  The Costco brand premium glossy photo paper, which worked flawlessly in the HP simply did not work in the brother 4710--the paper is too heavy to feed into this printer.  the paper simply falls under the paper tray and the printer displays an error message which requires opening and closing various ""doors"" on the printer to clear the message.  Eventually I got two photos to print--they turned out good but that was it--I simply could not get any more of the Costco photo paper to feed into the printer.  I had an old package of Kodak glossy photo paper which was lighter in weight---that worked but the photos did not come out as well probably because the Kodak paper was several years old.  The paper trays (this printer has two) are made of EXTREMELY thin plastic--not made for heavy use and certainly not ""Business Class""--be careful when handling them.  All that aside, the printing and scanning functions work well.  The scanning function is very fast and I like the fact that the scanned items can quickly and easily be emailed to where-ever.  The Ipad and the Android phone both work very well with the printer.  Have not used the fax via phone function since I am happy with the scan to email function.  The two sided print function is interesting and work well--the printer prints on one side then pushes the page out and pulls it back in to print on the other side.  The printer seems to use ink efficiently--it is still on the starter cartridges despite frequent use over the two month period.  Going back to the photo print issue--I will order the Brother photo paper to see how that works--it seems relatively expensive for approx $12.00 for 20 sheets compared to other brands including HP.  Also forgot--printer seems alittle faster that the HP 8500--it takes alittle bit to warm up for the first print--after the first print it is fast.  Where as the HP took considerable time to get ready for the first print.  The 4710 is definitely not as fast as the laser printer.",4,Not very sturdy feeling and needs special paper for photo,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",430,14,18,0.777777778,helpful

You're probalby only getting reject half filled cartridges included, and look at the cost of new cartridges and consider how frequently you may need to buy them unless you hardly ever do any printing.I bought the x5150 about 8 months ago and thought it was pretty good. Soon the cartridges emptied after not much printing and I learned the hard lesson. I knew the cartridges weren't cheap but I thought I'd refill them. That didn't work. I went to local refill company and was told the sponges in Lexmark cartridges are difficult (they gave up trying)and they only sold other companies' remanufactured or OEM. I tried one remanufactured Black and it was horizonaly streaky no matter what I did to fix it.People are fed up with printer manufacturers having cartridges with sponges that don't refill well (Lexmark), or smart chips that prevent refills (Epson), not to mention HP's methods including ""Expired Cartridge"" messages, etc. If we don't, as consumers, vote ""no"" by not buying these printers and sending letters to CEO's we'll just get more of the same scamming.I was excited to read about Canon Pixma IP3000 & up models with separate ink-tanks & no smart chips. Examining all the Pixma models at a local store I noticed this extra pull down tray in the front-middle. After full investigation, it's a disabled/never will work CD/DVD printing bay. Yet the same models in Europe have a working CD/DVD print bay. The USA price does not reflect the non-functional CD/DVD printing either. So I will (doubtedly) try to get a Euro model or wait for Canon to release USA models that are fully functional. I may end up temporarly buying the Epson R200 but I feel like I should be ashamed supporting Epson and their smart-chip scam. There is a chip resetter device (avg. $10 to $15) but I don't know if it works well yet. Forget Lexmark unless you have money to burn on cartridges. And there's concern about Epson printers wasting/spraying ink all over the inside (read all R200 reviews) that soon causes problems (dries solid/hard). The Canon has ink tanks with no smart chips, look easily refillable, and their print head underneath the ink tanks holder is also removable (i.e. replacable, but I don't know what that will cost. If other printers' print heads go you pretty much resort to trashing the printer). It looks like the Pixma line is leading the way in printing and cartridge technology.

However, I'm still finding it incredibly annoying for the following reasons:* The built-in symbol library is tiny and a pain to access (multi-level menus for every single symbol).  Ditto for the text library.* There's allegedly a way to create your own symbols using Rhino Connect software, but that software is nowhere to be found on Rhino's web site.  The product page for that software is an expired coupon from 2007 for a free CD ($199 value!); that sounds, to me, like they didn't have the software ready yet and wanted to market it anyway.  Presumably, if it existed, they'd be selling it by now.* The ""wrap"" modes, which should be great for cables, leave a wide margin at the edge of the label, so you don't really get the wrap effect on thinner cables (e.g. 18 AWG).* The print quality is spotty; sometimes the label looks good, sometimes there are pixels missing.  This is with several different types of label cartridges (heat shrink, flexible nylon.)* Hitting a wrong key at any point results in the whole LED display momentarily flashing at you.* The UI is clunky; there are separate keys for ""CLR"", ""ESC"", ""OK"", ""backspace"", and ""enter"", and each of them is used in different ways at different points to select menu items.* No auto-detection of cartridge size.  Even my P-Touch has this.* Cut labels don't fall out of the machine; you have to wave it around or lightly tap it upside-down to shake them out.* The backing is very difficult to peel, at least on the 1/2-inch nylon labels, because it's cut in half lengthwise along the entire label.  Brother's P-Touch models will do a ""half cut"" - they'll cut the label at the edge, and then cut only the backing a little ways in, so that you can peel off most of the backing in one step.* You can't mix type styles or sizes within a label.  So I can't, for instance, label my terminals as [1] [2] [3] (with boxes around the numbers), and then create a label showing ""24 VAC -> [1]""; either the whole label is boxed, or nothing at all.* You can't change fonts, period.  One font.* The color selection is very limited compared to P-Touch.* You can't print on the back of the heat-shrink tubing.  I guess I can't expect this from a handheld; it'd take twice the printing machinery.  Still, it's something I hadn't thought about before, and I'm sure I've seen heat-shring labels with true wrap-around capability, so somebody somewhere does it.  Otherwise, again, ""wraparound"" on a thin wire isn't very wraparound.Most importantly:* The thing can't auto-cut!  Again, my (relatively) cheapo P-touch has been able to do that for six years.  There is a cut button, but you can't tell the machine to cut after each printing.  At best, you can tell it to pause printing between labels, so YOU can press the cut button.  Clearly, they know we want to auto-cut, but the auto-pause was the best they were able to do for some reason...Given that, I don't see any reason to buy this over a nicer P-Touch model.  As for me, I'm going to think about splurging on a Brady - although it seems that they can't auto-cut either.

Colors are bright -- VERY BRIGHT -- so marking clothes for identification is a snap.  No more black marker fading into the fabric.3.  The markers stay within in the designated space without bleeding outward. Thus, these markers are excellent for creating designs on clothing.4.  They're just plain fun to use.CONS:1.  If all you're doing is marking clothes, you might do as well or even better with a fine line Sharpie.2.  Permanent markers are permanent (duh!), so you need to practice before putting Sharpie to fabric.

I didn't expect this Canon to be as fast or have as a good color fidelity from the outset, but certain design aspects impressed me quite a bit &lt;-- disclaimer for why I went so crazy with so many customer-submitted pictures.  Hmmm, After submitting the pics, I realized that the flash demo on the amazon page is pretty darn good.Anyways:1)The USB powered scanner is quite useful in that it's only powered when plugged into the computer.  There is no power button, but all you have to do is unplug it from the computer, and it's off.  Bootup/warm up time is quite fast.  Just plug into your computer, start the included software or Photoshop, and import/acquire.2)It does scan a little slower than the power scanners I'm used to, but it does the job.3)I remember awhile back an HP version of a tilted scanner (Scanjet 4600 series), and I wasn't too impressed by its scanning quality nor its functionality.  The ""upright"" function, I thought, was a gimmick, and not very useful.  But now I find that for things I want to scan quickly, a page at a time, I can just slide it in and scan.4)The included film adapter is very substantial.  It has its own light source, in comparison to other scanners which give you a slot/hole to shine light out of.  A substantial/separately mounted film adapter piece ensures that the background of the scanner is a nice even white as well.  On some of these other scanners, you see ridges from the plastic moldings that double up for the negatives.5)I am just soooo impressed by the design for the stand and the multi-angle lids.  The option of changing the angle of the lid WHEN you want to is a godsend.6)the lids and the negative film adapter are held in place with magnets.  This is great, as lids and adapter will come off and attach easily, without the wear-and-tear imposed upon plastic latches.7)I have been forever turned off by Epsons, as they are notorious for not updating their drivers for new OSs.  I remember trying to update an Epson from Win2K to WinXP, and I just could not do it.  Bye bye Epson.8)I've tried the negative scanning once, and although a little on the slow side, (1200 dpi), the resulting image was quite good.I think this is a great scanner for home usage, and even for perhaps small businesses.

It prints regular documents and photos, scans, copies, and faxes, all in a single machine.The paper tray holds approximately 135 sheets, so if you print a lot, you might be better off with theEpson WorkForce 840 Wireless All-in-One, which holds 500 sheets, but this Canon feels both sturdier and more compact than the Epson.It's relatively easy to set up using the supplied instructions.  I wish Canon made it easier by installing the print head at the factory; although it isn't difficult to do, that step irked me since I didn't have to do it on my Epson or my HP.  The inks are included -- three color cartridges (#226), a black photo ink (also #226), and a black document ink (#225.)  The ink cartridges seem smaller than my HP Photosmart ones, although I can't tell you how they compare in terms of actual amount. I recommend shopping around to find a good source of brand-name inks.  Don't bother with generics.  I had the printer up and running about ten minutes after I opened the box -- on the network, configured for faxes, and stocked with paper and ink.For wireless use, you must install the software on each machine that will use the printer.  For initial set-up to get the printer on your network, you'll need to know the network security password, but after that, you just need to configure the settings on each computer. Once that's done, you can print wirelessly from anywhere in the network, on both Macs and PCs.  I was astounded by how quickly this worked, even from the other side of the house.I highly recommend this printer.  It's the best of the Canon wireless All-in-One line.

It just doesn't work. You'll have to play with the settings a lot to get a contrast that works most of the time, and even then you'll have to squint a lot.2) It's slow!! Contrary to what some say, it does conjugate verbs in all tenses, you just have to keep on tapping the CONJ button. However, switching between tenses is SLOOOW!! There's a wait of maybe three seconds, and what's worse, if the tense you want is the very last one, there's no way to skip ahead! You have to tap the CONJ button 15-odd times, waiting 3 seconds each time. That's 45 seconds - I could have looked up the conjugation in my verb book in half that time or less!

Huang ""Teddy""","[24, 24]","My review will be skewed because this is the first ECR that I've ever bought and set up, and I've only used a register at Walgreen's in high school without knowing how to program it. I will explain my rating and then give more details later.I am giving this 5 stars because it fulfills my needs (please note what I will write about what features I needed and did not need), but subtracting 1 star (maybe 2) because the instructions can be unclear and I need to email Sharp to answer some of my questions. The new price on Amazon was the best I could find. Most retailers were selling for at least $200.My needs are a couple hundred PLUs for preset pricing, only a few clerks, only several departments. My bonus wants were a nice multi-line LCD, RS232 port for credit card terminal hookup, and programming on PC and paperless reports through an SD card. The XE-A207 does all of this, and the price is only $140 on amazon, which seems good to me, although I've never bought a cash register before. What I didn't need and what this product didn't have is a bar code scanner for UPCs, other ports for peripherals such as a scale, and a larger cash box. For more functions, you'd either need a higher model such as the XE-A507, or a customizable POS system. If you didn't need the SD card or the single RS232 port, or fewer PLUs, then you could get the XE-A106, which i think is about $80-$90. I don't know much about other brands. It seems that the other large manufacturer of small-business ECRs is Casio, but their product descriptions on their website were too vague to figure out which one I needed, so I focused on Sharp products.For me, the programming is not that hard, but this is almost certainly subjective. The menus are navigated just like any menu in an electronic device. You go in and out of the menu tree with arrow keys and enter/escape keys, and edit the settings with the keypad. The departments and PLUs probably take the most time to set up, and you can also do it on your computer with an SD card. However, you need the full-sized SD card, not a smaller SD form with an adapter. You need to download a small standalone program from Sharp, called a Customer Support Tool. The software is fairly simple, but may take extra time to learn for some people.What I don't like was that the instruction manual is often vague. It was probably written in Japanese, then translated to English. It's not that the grammar is incorrect, but that the names of the settings and some of the choices sometimes are not self-explanatory. The manual also does not give a lot of description for the choices and functions. You often have to perform trial-and-error to figure out how to do things. For example, I had no idea what it meant to change a credit card payment's ""tender"" to ""inhibit"" or ""compulsory."" After trial-and-error, my best guess is that inhibit means you can only charge whatever the subtotal is, and compulsory means you can and must enter how much was charged to the card. Discounts do not reduce tax by default, and I was confused because you have to set the discount's ""tax,"" or ""taxable"" according to the manual, to ""yes."" That is confusing because you'd think discounts are NOT taxable, so that tax is applied after the discount is taken off. Another example is that the manual mentions testing the connection to a credit card terminal, but does not explain how connecting a credit card terminal changes how you manage the payment on the ECR. Another example is that there is type of report called the ""Electronic Journal,"" which is like a compilation of every action (even programming) done on the machine. When you ""save & clear"" it to an SD card, it does not reset the EJ as the manual says. It only resets if you do it on the machine through the ""Z"" menu. The EJ file (.SDA ?) can be read by Excel (the manual did not say this), although an occasional character shows up as a weird symbol. It is also strange that you cannot reset the daily/monthly transaction reports after you save to the SD card. You can only do that with the Z function, and that will use up paper.",4,"Nice entry level ECR for price, instructions not totally clear",1348185600,"09 21, 2012",744,24,24,1,helpful

Most are easy to use right out of the box.  Plug it in, install driver, and voila.  Your hardware is ready to use.  The Canon imageCLASS is certainly not one of those.  Your everyday user/person is going to struggle with setting this up for several reasons.  The first is putting the parts together.  One of the parts in the back, where you have to align hinges in to holes in order to create a door, you have to literally use brute force to bend the plastic far enough so that the other hinge can fit in to the door.  My fingers still hurt front the sharp edges that they ran in to in order to get a firm enough grip, all the while worrying that I was going to break the plastic.  Second, the installation didn't work.  I tried it several times, rebooting the computer and so on and the installation disc provided would not work!  Luckily I was able to go through the control panel and have Microsoft recognize it and install a driver to get it to work.  Finally, and this is a big oversight by Canon, why would you not provide all the necessary supplies to have the printer run out of the box?  The box comes with the printer, a manual on a cd, installation cd, and a power cord.  Their instructions say that is all that comes in the box.  Where is the USB cord?  The network cable?  Luckily I had a USB cable from my old printer, but what if I was setting up a new office and didn't have anything?  I'd get everything set up and then, wait, I have to go to the store and buy a USB to set up my printer?  Doesn't make sense.  First hardware I've seen that doesn't give you all the necessary supplies to get everything running.  Not sure why everyone else says it sets up fast when it took me a while to fiddle through installation and part issues.As for the printing itself it is very fast and crisp.  I don't print pictures or graphics, so for text purposes this certainly does the job.  It is extremely quiet when sitting idle, but when it prints it is pretty loud.  I had a paper jam the very first time I tried to use it.  For some reason it prints, and then pulls the paper all the way back in before spitting the paper back out, which is where it jammed.  I presume because of its double sided printing capabilities, but if I'm only printing a one sided page why would it need to pull it all the way back in?  Clearing the jam wasn't that easy.  I mean I cleared the jam immediately, but then the instructions on the LCD screen told me to then open the bottom drawer in the back, which I did, and then to open the front door, which I did, and still the jam did not clear.  I repeated process and found that the missing step they don't tell you was that I had to pull the ink cartridge out and put it back in for the system to clear the jam.  Kind of lengthy process for something I cleared in a matter of seconds.All in all I am unsure about this product.  With the difficulties in setting up, as well as getting started in regards to USB cable and driver installation, it is a bit cumbersome and ornery, especially for this day and age when this should be an easy process.  The printing is fast and crisp, if a bit loud, but a jam on the first print and the subsequent clearing of it made things harder than they needed to be.  Can't really say it is a bad printer, as the printing I have done is what you would expect, but I can't really say it is a great printer either simply by the errors and problems I have already run in to with the little use that I have had of it.3 stars.",3,Decent printer with some issues...,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",693,9,14,0.642857143,helpful
942526,ATOKT8QYK967L,B005J7Y6GS,"Steve B ""Mac User""","[83, 87]","This is a comparison review of the Epson LW-300 and LW-400 labelers that I received from Amazon Vine to review, and the Brother P-touch 1880 that I bought from Costco. All three are in the same approximate price range, although the Brother was significantly cheaper than SRP at Costco. I'll hit upon the key differences that I noted but will not discuss the PC linking available to the P-touch 1880 since it doesn't work with a Mac.The Epson 400 screen is a two-line display comprised of illuminated blue letters on a white background, making it MUCH easier to read than the 300 or the Brother. In addition, the size and shape make the 400 more conducive to handheld portable labeling use. The 300 is smaller and somewhat lighter, and would work well for the same purpose, but the shape is not as efficient for secure, handheld use. The 400 also includes a lanyard attachment point making it even better for secure portability and ease of use. The Brother is designed for desktop use, but is light enough to be portable and it runs on 6 batteries like the Epson units (Epson 400 and Brother use AA; Epson 300 uses AAA).All three units are cartridge systems. The Epson labeling tape cartridge is removed or inserted by easily removing the back. The batteries are in the same area so they are replaced the same way. The Brother's batteries are in back also, but the cartridge is inserted by lifting an access flap on top. Brother's method is easier, and doesn't require setting down the back piece while inserting the cartridge, nor would you need to lay the display face down in the process, thus eliminating the chance of scratching the bezel in the process. However, with care, the Epson method should present no issues to the user, but would take a few seconds longer to accomplish.I printed a sample from each machine and tried to include pictures of those samples but it is not yet allowed by Amazon. The resolution of the Brother is somewhat superior to both of the two Epson units, the outputs of which appear identical to me. It is important to note, however, that the Epson units provide quite acceptable results for most applications. But if clarity is of primary importance to you, then the Brother appears to be the more capable unit for large, standard-sized text. The small text is crisp and clear on the all machines. The easy to remove split-back tape is universal between all the machines. Brother claims to make hardier tapes, but I did not have the facilities to test longevity on either brand. Tactilely, the Brother tapes feels stiffer and stronger to me, but not by much. Some Epson tapes can be ironed on, but I do not know if Brother has entered this realm.Another area where the Brother excels is in print speed. The two Epson units printed the 52 letters in my test about 33% slower than the Brother. (Brother 29.2 seconds; both Epson units took 40.1 sec).But where the Epson units excel compared to Brother is in the lack of product waste through lead in and lead out. The short, 10mm lead-in and lead-out are appropriate to prevent jamming in the printer and better tape adhesion, plus they require no manual trimming unless used in a tight spot. (At the time of this review, the Epson tapes were not available for sale so I could not provide a comparison price, but the tapes issued with the labelers are longer than Brother's at 9 meters long, and appear on the Epson site at the same length). The Brother tapes are NOT cheap. The 12mm tapes are 26 feet long and currently cost ~$12-14, or roughly 50/ft, and it wastes about an inch at each end unless the settings are adjusted to trim that back on one end to save about 3/4"". But the other end is not adjustable so it must be manually trimmed for balance if the other end is reduced to save product, wasting time as well as material. If your labels are short (say 2"", for file folders) then  of the tape is wasted!!! That computes out to $6 of every $12 spent going into the trash!All of these labelers include multiple fonts, various sizes, some special characters, multiple symbols, and various formatting options. Of note is that the Brother is limited to two fonts whereas the Epson has 14 fonts, including old english and script, albeit pretty lame looking in my opinion. In addition, the 300 can print on two lines (like the Brother) but the 400 can put out some pretty sharp 3 and 4 line labels, although the text is pretty tiny (as expected). The method of showing multiple lines on the 300's single-line display is a series of letters with a symbol showing the beginning of the second line. The 400's two-line display is much better. It shows each line separately, and the lines can be scrolled for review, thus making it easier to balance the line lengths.One thing that irritated me about the Brother is apparently common to the Epson 300 and 400: the largest print size is the same on the 1/2"" tape as it is on the 3/4"" tape. I was hoping that the print head would take advantage of the extra print area, but it does not. The additional tape width is apparently to make the label stand out, or to help in adhering to the surface to which it is attached; it is not to make the font bigger.These new labelers take a little getting used to. In order to provide all the functionality, fonts, special characters, symbols, etc, several keystrokes are sometimes required. This is common with all three units. Once the user gets familiar with the function, however, it doesn't take long to compose and print one or multiple labels. The Epson printers come with basic use guides adhered to the back for quick reference.There are a couple of other nice features incorporated in the 400 that I found useful and convenient. It will format your labels so that they become either index tabs, cable flag labels, cable wrapped labels, or even barcode labels. At home or in business, it's nice to have the formatting for these types of labels already built into the machine.The functionality of the 300 and 400 are the nearly the same; same print speed, same fonts, symbols, and styling, same borders, same print clarity, etc. The differences lie in the 400's much improved display, better portability, and the additional built-in labeling formats (see above). Except for the slightly reduced clarity, the Epson units are both more functional and less wasteful than the Brother I own, and if the tapes are comparably priced, they'd be cheaper to operate.At the time of this review the Epsons were priced at $39 for the 300 and $49 for the 400, which is also the SRP. The display and other features on the Epson 400 makes it a wise choice for the additional $10. I'm rating these machines based on bang for the buck.[SAFETY NOTE: according to the safety instructions, the Epson units are not designed to be used as a step. If you or one of your employees want to use a plastic labeler to gain a couple inches in height, you can expect the thing to break.]",4,"Very Good Labeler, but a little slow",1317859200,"10 6, 2011",1233,83,87,0.954022989,helpful

117783,A2NUBQBO4AC491,B0001F9KLY,"Jerry Nixon ""Regular Guy""","[25, 29]","I regret purchasing this phone, but there's really nothing better out there.I have only owned it for a month now.My Siemens Gigaset System was made inoperable by a wicked caller id bug they don't seem to have plans to fix. It was also 2.4 Ghz and my microwave and 802.11b network caused the handsets to pop. I wanted a new expandable system that had a similar form factor (corded speakerphone on the base) but at a fraction of Siemens inordinately high cost.The Uniden TRU888 is really the only expandable system on the market that could ever compare. I bought it. Now I know it just barely compares Siemens (who seems to be bowing out of the consumer home phone market in the US).Here's why I say that.The Uniden is boxy. The Siemens had that European sexy and sleek minimalist thing going on - it regularly showed up on television sitcoms, probably because it was so cool looking. I felt the Siemens was an accessory to my house. The Uniden is embarrassing.The Uniden has this silly belt clip that sticks out a good inch or more - making it impossible to actually fit under a bet and making it fatter than it ever really need be. The whole form factor is clunky, although the base handset is extremely heavy - something I actually like.The Uniden has this annoying beep beep beep that the base announces until you finally check your messages. If you are using call screening or ""let the machine get it"" while you are watching a movie or having a nice Easter dinner, it will nag the crap out of you until you finally go listen to new messages.The Uniden has the day and time on the handset which is nice, but it is only the weekday (Mon, Tue, Wed) - not the actual date. This is system-wide and it means that when you get a voice mail, you have to figure out the date for yourself, it just tells you the weekday. Is it really so hard to account for the month and year? No.The Uniden does not display the caller id information on the voice message! The Siemens, in contrast, even let you ""call back"" while you were listening to a message just by picking up the handset.The Uniden has the goofiest user interface I could have ever dreamed up. It is extremely clunky - almost to the point that my wife prefers to not use it. Accessing the speakerphone, the phone book, especially changing settings is an exercise in patience.The Uniden hides the caller id information or the number you are dialing as soon as you push talk. I suppose I could thumb through the caller id list or the redial list, but it's just another example of a weak user interface.The Uniden phone book works basically the same as the Siemens did (why can't a USB interface sync with Outlook contacts?) with the exception that the Uniden cannot delete the book at one time. With 40 entries on 2 handsets + the base, clearing the phone book is a carpal tunnel-causing experience, deleting 120 records with no less than three actions each.The Uniden does not do a good job of displaying the phone book entry with the incoming caller id information. I don't know what I am doing wrong, but it's nuts. The manual is helpful, but very inadequate. If you want anything past the basic stuff, it is no real help.The Uniden is lacking so many features:It simply doesn't handle area codes at all; it's horrible. There is no barring certain area codes. There is no inserting a call around prefix. The handset does not work if cradled. There is no way to turn features off - like storing caller id or the annoying beep beep beep on the base. There is no way to restrict dial or pick-up access to a single handset. Transferring a call does not work like you expect. And all the other great stuff I enjoyed with the Siemens phone.It does a few things well, though:The handset speakerphone is superb. The illuminated keyboard is great. Distinct ring tones for phone book entries is cool. The ability to manage global settings from a handset is neat. The day and time on the handset display is handy.But that's about it.The reality is, I had no choice but to buy this phone. There is nothing on the market that is half as good - as far as I have found - and Siemens seems to be out of the home phone market. Had I never owned a better phone, I would likely be enamored with this Uniden. But once you taste the best, the rest just isn't.If I have to say one good thing about this phone it would be that it is inexpensive.",3,It's just not Siemens,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",802,25,29,0.862068966,helpful

No, seriously, she uses it too, and we both love it!  The quality of the photographic output is on a par with my friend's top-of-the-line Epson and just as good as my father's Canon i850.  It has more nice features than I can list here, so I won't try, but I do love the fact that the paper feeder is right under the output tray so you can fit this printer on a book-shelf with low overhead clearance.  Why don't all printers have that?  The quality of text and graphics is indistinguishable from a laser printer without magnification.  Most of all, color gradients are the smoothest of any ink-jet I've ever seen, and there is absolutely no sign of the horizontal striping that so many ink-jets put down.  On the down side, saturation is slightly less vivid than the Epson, and the Canon leaves it in the dust speed-wise.You may read some less-than-enthusiastic comments from other reveiwers, both here and at ZDNet and Consumer Reports, and I think there are logical reasons why this could be.  For starters, I'm much more concerned about quality than I am about speed.  Others seem less patient than me.  Their choice.  In real life, I'm getting almost two text pages per minute under CUPS with hpijs set to 600DPI, which I think most would consider overkill for all but resume printing.  I don't think that's so slow for high quality output on an ink-jet.  ""Wait a minute"", you say...""CUPS?  hpij...what was that?"".  This brings me to my other point.I have decided to wean myself from the inferior products that The Monopolist (Microslop, that is) is trying to force down everyone's throat.  I am using Linux as my main OS, and I'm loving every minute of it.  You should give Linux a try, too--you'd be amazed at how much better it is.  No more crashes...no more viruses...tons of software, most of it free--it works, and it's great.Anyway, HP has decided to allow open-source programmers access to the information they need to write high-quality drivers for their printers.  Basically, this means that Linux fully supports my HP printer.  The other printer I was looking at--my father's Canon, does not.  While this is very unfortunate, I'm sure it is no accident.  The Monopolist will do anything in its power to kill off competition, even if that means paying peripheral vendors to not grant access licenses to developers from competing organizations.  And no, I'm not being paranoid.  Check the news.So some people are reporting less than stellar output quality.  Indeed, what I saw coming out of the printers in a demonstration in Albany, NY would have seemed to corroborate that printers like the Canon i850 edge the HP out somewhat in terms of quality.  But the reviews I read were conflicting, and I wanted to buy a company that supports open source software, and so I took a chance.  Wow!!  The quality I saw when I got it home was much better than what I saw at that demo.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's the high quality of the renowned hpijs Linux printer drivers.  Maybe I just got a really sweet specimen.  Maybe they were using the wrong type of paper at the demo.  Who knows?Oh, and by the way, when other users report that they were out of ink after their first day of printing, keep in mind that the ""starter set"" of printing cartridges included with the printer (at no extra cost) are only half full.  So the HP isn't really an ink glutton, after all.  It's about average, in fact, although it's cartridges are slightly more expensive than some because the print heads are part of the cartridge and not built into the machine.  This means that if one should get gummed up, you're out [money] for a new cartridge instead of a hundred or more for a new print head.",5,I'm impressed,1044144000,"02 2, 2003",669,18,24,0.75,helpful

There are no proper reviews online.1200x1200 dpi is uncommon at this price - don't get fooled by printers that quote 2400x600 dpi.

1197565,A3P9HOAZ2GEJAE,B00DJG8D88,T. Tijerina,"[14, 14]","The good:This printer has many many features that I've been looking for, One its LED not laser based so that is cool. Second, it has auto duplexing (does both sides) on both printing and scanning. This feature is a must have for mulitple documents. Its handled many document types and is pretty easy. I really appreciate the fact that you can unfold what you need when you need it. For example if you don't want something bent, you can open the back tray and it will unload there. The manual feed is a door on the front, and the ADF of the scanner is opened from the top. Its like a transformer printer. Most of the time it sits in the corner all closed up, and when you need it its there.The other REALLY big bonus that I love is you can communicate from several different ways, USB, wifi, or ethernet. I really dislike wifi for a printer and refused to buy another one. Wifi can be tweaky from time to time and I didn't want to have to deal with resetting it. If wifi was your only option, setting the security and putting in the wifi password with this touchscreen makes it a breeze. You don't need to install software.I run Linux (Ubuntu 13.10) and the install was a breeze, pretty easy to follow instructions on their website.The Bad:I've uploaded two pictures, one shows what a photo looks like when copied the other shows a diagnostic test page I printed while on with tech support. Now I didn't expect the photo to look as good as it does, and that is pretty good for a laser printer I believe. Many people were asking so I uploaded a before and after. If I need a quick photo I can use this, if I want a photo quality I'll take it somewhere. I don't print enough pictures to use the ink in an inkjet, and it gets expensive to have to buy new cartridges every time you want to print. That is why I went with toner based printers and I'll never look back. (I've had my last printer almost a year, and never used its starter toner)The page that shows the colors, you can see several streaks in it, this I was told is normal, and there is nothing they will do about it. I find this a bit unsettling, and as a result it leads me into...The Ugly:Tech support. I do tech support for a living, and I know it isn't the agents its the policies the company has in place. I've had horrible experience with both this company and Samsung. I'll give Samsung credit though, they were better then these guys. If you chat your going to be in for a bad experience. They will give you a link and try to rush you off, even if you have followed the instructions. They will send you multiple links that are very close to the step by step of each other with one or two differences, and won't explain it after you inform them of what you have done. If you use Linux its worse, they will use that as an excuse to not troubleshoot your machine, and will quickly dismiss you or blame your OS even when its clearly the printer, such is the case with the bleeding lines.Overall:Tech support with Linux is always a nightmare, but this company does have great instructions and documentation online. They will however use it as an excuse to dismiss you as fast as possible. The lines bother me, but they refuse to do anything and there isn't anything within $200 more that will satisfy all my requirements such as this one does. Automatic duplexing is such a desired feature for me I won't go without it now. The color isn't, and never will be photo realistic, but for a quick image of something, or for printing a webpage it works just fine. Overall I took one star away for the inconsistent toner in printing, and one for horrible customer service/tech support. I didn't have these lines with my last Samsung laser printer, and tech support reports it is normal. I don't believe them but I've been told that by a few agents so at this point I give up. If I had another option I would take it, but I don't that has the features I want in this (or even $200 more) price range.",3,Excellent for the price range its in.,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",744,14,14,1,helpful

It eats ink up much less thanthe Canon MP830 I had. Ink usage was the primary  reason I decided to retirethe MP830. Also, when doing duplex, the HP does use its black ink for blackdata rather than using the color ink to make black as the canon does. Again,more efficient. I haven't used all the features, but faxing, printing, coping andtransferring pictures from the card readers has worked perfectly. The L7780,at least on my machine, didn't add drives under 'my computer' for the card readers.Instead, it transfers the pictures by means of the included driver. My oldPSC actually placed drives for each of the 4 card slots in 'my computer'. Ihave not yet replaced any ink cartridges. Its been a month and all are overhalf full still. I think one key to ink usage is not turning on the printerif your not going to use. I believe that a process at power up uses some inkin getting the printer ready for printing. I have a WIFI network in the homeand my notebook uses that. It was very easy getting the notebook to print tothe WIFI enabled L7780. If something happens at the printer, it will comeaccross the WIFI and give me error messages on the notebook as if I was onthe desktop which is directly connected to the L7780.

It seems that the HP software that should bring it all together...does anything but that. The software and the document scanner are the two biggest let downs. About the software; its cumbersome, some 800MB worth of bells and whistles that only highschoolers would find useful. Software also has issues installing. Software is not user friendly and photo gallery interface is force-fed to all users. Oh and it sometimes crashes. The Hardware; the document feeder is designed for 2-7 pages. I have 30 page reports I need to scan and they always, yes always Jam. The irritating part is the software crashing when a document jams. The software has to be exited out of and restarted every time there is a paper jam. Duplex printing works great and the speed is also fast (B/W is almost as fast as a warmedup laser). Great for a fancy home printer but If you are looking for a business machines, with a working document feeder, spend the extra money and go for a standalone document scanner like the fujitsu (Which I will have to do after spending almost 500 bucks). Other smaller issues are the low yield and expensive ink cartridges. All in all, for a home printer this consolidates a lot of functions. Too big for dorm rooms and small desks so size is something to keep in mind. Good machine but could be better.

This is one of Canon's newest models and it was the easiest yet to install.  The PIXMA MX420 also functions as a network sheet-feed or flat-platen scanner, color or black and white photocopy machine and a fax machine all in one low-cost package.  I tested its capabilities and they all worked quite well.  This device will work just fine when it's connected to a single computer with a USB cable (not supplied) but what is really handy is being able to share its many functions with everybody on the network.Although this device will also work with a CAT-5 network connection, my installation was a good test for this device's Wi-Fi sensitivity.  I located this multi-function machine on the second floor and at the opposite end of my home from my wireless router, which is in my cellar.  During the set-up process the printer quickly found my Wi-Fi signal.  After entering my WEP encryption code into the printer it was ready to be ""found"" on the network by the installation software.  Installing the software and registering the printer on-line went without a hitch.Unlike Canon's higher-end models, such as the PIXMA MX882 which uses five separate ink cartridges (three for color and two for black and white), this model uses only two ink cartridges; one for black and white and the other for color.  Using Canon brand glossy photo paper this printer delivered excellent, lab-quality photo prints.  Prints on other brands of glossy photo paper were disappointing.  On plain photocopy paper, text and graphics look very good.Color prints can also be made directly from compatible cameras and memory cards, simply by plugging them into the appropriate place on the front of the PIXMA MX420 and then using the small LCD color screen to choose what you want to print and how.  The scanner works directly with TWAIN compatible applications such as Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, Corel Photo-Paint or via the Canon utilities included with this device on the installation disk.If you ever have a problem, Canon has support people who are in the USA, actually answer the phone and can communicate clearly in the English language.  My first-hand experience with Canon's support people has been very positive.  In summary, this device packs multiple capabilities into a single low-cost package that can be accessed by any computer on the network where it's installed.  A step-up to Canon's PIXMA MX882 for an additional cost of $50 to $60 will add a second software-selectable paper source and separate ink tanks for better photo reproduction and lower ink cost on all brands of glossy photo paper.",4,Does A Lot for Its Price and Size,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",438,222,229,0.969432314,helpful

Run installation software. Ignore the wireless setup utility, it does not work (failed to recognize printer when connected via USB)Manually select the wireless network using the printer's touch screen controls.

A few additional pointers:  I found the best quality was achieved with: 3200 dpi for negatives with the minimum jpg compression possible and 6400dpi for slides with a little bit of compression.  These images ended up aroud 5 to 8 megabytes.  At both resolutions, a fair amount of unsharp mask is needed which is best done in photoshop so if you don't intended to do any post processing, I would limit the resolution to 1200 dpi. This resolution or lower is also best for posting to sharing web sites. I have also tried several image processing programs and still find photo shop elements virtually essential and wouldn't even think about doing editing without it.July Review:I have 40 years of slides and negatives to scan and over the last ten years have researched different scanners and tried a few with little satisfaction.  I have also done a few slides commercially but the cost to do the entire collection was prohibitive.  I purchased my first V500 last November and it worked so well that I bought a second one to speed up the process.  I am now about 1/2 the ways through my images and have only 3,000 or so to go.  Although I am sure dedicated scanners are likely better, I can't tell the difference between prints from the V500 scans and commercial prints from the slides so this scanner has certainly met my needs.A few pointers from what I have learned:  It did not install automatically in Vista and I had to manually load the drivers which was annoying but not a real problem.  As other users have pointed out the bundled Adobe was problematic.  The full version of Adobe though is well worth the money and I am using Adobe 7.0 and there have been no issues with it.  The Digital ICE is fantastic.  Don't even think about scanning without it.  ICE sometimes creates artifacts with Kodachrome but this is easily resolved in Photoshop.  This is a bit time consuming but the quality is worth it. I scanned my first 200 slides without it, both for speed and to avoid the artifacts but there was way too much dust so I rescanned them. As others have pointed out, the included  software sucks.  I only use it when I don't care much about the quality.  Photoshop's smart fix is much better.  I usually only turn on the unsharp mask and grain reduction (both on low) and as mentioned earlier, always use DIGITAL ICE. In my opinion 48-bit color is mandatory if you are going to edit and I use 6400 DPI resolution. I couldn't see any improvement at higher resolutions. I think somewhat lower resolution would be OK for most people especially if they want to post on line, as some sites will not accept this high of a resolution. At these settings, each  image takes about 5 minutes with most of this time for processing.  My computers are Pentium 4's 3.0 Ghz with 3 GIG of RAM.  A faster processor I would expect would work quicker.  As some others have mentioned, the plastic masks are somewhat fragile.  I broke one but a bit superglue made for a good fix.  I had a green line through the images on one scanner for a few scans as mentioned by one of the other reviewers but turning off the scanner and turning it back on resolved this (at least for the last 3 months). Get a good brush to clean the slides.  I use a Staticmaster.  Also keep the glass clean.

The product arrived within 7 days of my order (I live in Hawaii - so this was pretty quick as it goes).  The installation of the drivers and network configuration was a snap using the disk they provided.  Based on one of the reviews here that the duplex printing capability required technical support, the very first thing i tried was to duplex print.  After eating the first page through and jamming, I then tried again and it worked perfectly.  The next thing I tried was color printing.  I picked a fairly complex graphic and the print came out with wild colors that were nothing like what was in the graphic.  After trying a number of calibration settings, reading the manual etc., I finally broke down and called technical support.  I was on hold for 5-7 minutes before a very knowlegeable and nice tech support rep picked up and helped me.  He immediately identified the problem which was that I am running Windows 7 64-bit system and the driver for the printer was a 32-bit driver.  The technician did a remote desktop session and he took care of configuring the correct driver and a couple of other settings and presto! it now works like a charm.  He also registerd my warranty for me so that was taken care of as well in the call.  The only other issue I have encountered so far is that right after I installed the printer driver, I tried to print a file from Adobe Acrobat Reader version 10.  When I hit print, the screen would blink and the file would close.  I tried a different printer and it still did this.  The Konica Minolta rep checked with one of his colleagues who said he had encountered this issue before.  The fix was to uninstall Adobe Reader, do a cold shutdown, power the computer back up and then reinstall Adobe.  This worked.  On the one hand, I would have liked this printer to be plug and play, but on the other, it seems par for the course these days that nothing is easy in the technology world.

I pay less now for a month of unlimited service with Vonage, than I did just to have a line with caller-id at my old provider.  That's saying something.  Anyway, my issue with this product, and the reason is receives 2 stars from me is because the Phone Adapter is LOCKED to the Vonage service.""Setup is simple: Just connect one end of the included Vonage-certified Linksys PAP2 phone adapter to your Ethernet router or gateway and the other end to your telephone. Then sign up for Vonage phone service."" This is how Amazon describes it.  A nice little endorsement for the tie-in product.  The ""Vonage-certified"" wording makes it seem as if this device is a phone adaptor that work with other VoIP providers but is guaranteed to work on the Vonage network.  A better choice of words would be Vonage-locked, or Vonage-only so that you know exactly what you're getting.  I feel like I've been tricked into buy this product.  Nowhere on the packaging did I see that this was a Vonage only device.  Why did I spend $50+s/h to buy this device when I can get a device directly from Vonage for less? At least if I got the adapter straight from Vonage I would get my money back when I returned it if I chose to cancel my service.I thought I was buying a phone adapter that I could port to other services (Voicepulse, SunRocket, Lingo, Packet8 etc.) but instead I got an overpriced, locked piece of hardware that Vonage, itself, basically gives away for free.

So I was going to buy one of those stand-alone answering devices. You know, one of those things that ONLY records messages, no phones attached or anything. But I kept reading pretty negative reviews for most of them. But I read good reviews for this and it not just an answering machine but also a cordless phone. I figure, that's not a bad deal.I'm glad I purchased this instead of one of those other devices. The sound quality of the phone is very good, and the footprint (the amount of desk space it takes up) is almost just as small as one of those dedicated answering machines. Using it is pretty simple too. If you have a new message waiting, the big, easy to see and press, play button will flash red. Pretty logical. The sound quality of the recording and playback is very good, I haven't had an issue trying to understand a name or phone number on the message yet.But the best feature about the answering machine part of this phone is the ability to play back the messages on the actual handset. So you can be downstairs, away from the base, and still listen to your messages. The sound quality of listening to the messages that way is just as good, if not better since you can hold it right up to your ear if you like.The phone itself works fairly well. Visually, it looks pretty nice. It doesn't have a visible antenna, but the reception is pretty good, although I haven't tried walking down the street with the phone yet to test out what the range of it was. The sound quality is very good, and the speakerphone also works quite well.The only thing is that the handset, while visually attractive, feels a little weird in the hands at first. But it's not THAT bad and you get used to it pretty quickly, so it's no big deal.I say if you're looking for an answering device, just get this, and you can expand it later with the stand-alone handsets and chargers so you can replace all of your outdated phones in your house with matching cordless phones if you like. And it's made by Panasonic, a brand you can trust.

Sound very clear, battery life is long (my actual 1st day experience was 3-5 hr talking with 10+ in standby), and range is longer than my previous Motorola 5 GHZ model (good enough for a 2 story house plus a basement). The model includes cordless handsets, answering machine, and caller ID, as well as voice prompts of incoming caller ID calls.  As a plus, the handsets use AAA Ni-MH batteries so easily purchased when they need replacing.  My old Motorola used the typical specialized phone Ni-Cd batteries (with that funny connector), that lasted less than a year and a high cost to replace.Highly recommend this model.  The KX-TG 643x and 644x series are all the same except for the number of handsets that come in the package and whether the base station has its own dial capability.  This model allows a max of 6 handsets (the 6445 cmes with 5 handsets-so you can purchase one more if needed KX-TGA 641T).The caller ID list and address book is centralized, so updating updates the file on the base set.  My old Motorola had an address book in each handset plus a shared in the base unit.  The voice mail box default announcement is a man's voice-would prefer a woman's voice, but you can also record your own announcementLastly, the handsets are small(6inch by 1.5 in wide).  Not a problem for me but might surprise others.  Panasonic sells many DECT 6.0 cordless phones, so do your search carefully.

Just so you know, I am an ergo veteran with my computer workstation.  I have tried yoga balls, knee chairs, standing up, laying down, etc. Currently I am back in a chair (Humanscale Freedom, 5 stars) with a traditional desk. Next up I may try a treadmill (the latest ergo craze).I use an iMac 24"" with 2 extra 24"" monitors for a total of 3 displays, or a Lenovo T500 laptop with 2 24"" displays attached.  I love multiple displays. So the Ergotron LX Dual seemed like an ideal product, especially the updated polished version that is more robust and better looking.Anyway, this thing goes together easily and is a formidable addition to your space. Be prepared to rearrange all the crap on and around your desk to accommodate this thing while you assemble and tweak it.So, how does it work? Well, the 24"" monitors (Samsung 245T and HP ZR24W) apparently put the piston near its limit.  I had to really mess with the tension to get the arm tight enough to support the displays without creeping down.  Once it is set, it stays, but I am having trouble finding the sweet spot where I can move the display with a light one-handed touch. I have only had the mount for a couple days so I will update this review once I get it sorted.I have not mounted the iMac yet, though I really, really want to get it off that worthless stand. By the way, the Apple VESA adapter I bought was defective, so check the tolerance on that thing before taking your iMac stand off.  I am skeptical that the Ergotron will adequately support it, but it is within the 20lb spec so we'll see. Right now the iMac remains on its high tech stack of books.The cable management for the lower arm is a clever plastic tray that snaps onto the bottom. The cable management for the upper arm is a friggin' plastic cable tie. Ugh! Fortunately I have a few velcro ties in my arsenal and cleaned that up, do yourself a favor and buy some to have on hand (like these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5K82A/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?ie=UTF8&cloe;_id=97a0841e-b8c6-4ce6-8c26-947df72d47bb&attrMsgId;=LPWidget-A2&pf;_rd_p=486539851&pf;_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf;_rd_t=201&pf;_rd_i=B00000J1SC&pf;_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_r=11X2J1D5JS1R951NCFDB)The big complaint I have is not a design flaw, but a product of my needs not being met by this design. This system does not raise the monitors high enough off my desk. Once it is all set up and the displays are raised to their highest position, they are not any higher than if they were on their stands. I want to be able to gain a few more inches.One option is to adjust the mount and add a piece of wood as a shim for a maximum gain of an inch. This would look hideous, though, and I can't decide if I want a block of wood staring at me from beneath my expensive equipment. Another approach would be to have a sleeve machined to raise the base poles... hrmmm. I have searched on Ergotron's site for a replacement mount with a higher pole, but apparently the only option is the dual LX with a single higher pole instead of two lower fixed ones. But this model does not allow side-by-side 24"" displays.

The included software has no options for scanning and faxing a document using a modem either; I use winfax so that does not bother me.

This mat really helps a lot, but over time, a depression has developed in the middle where the chair sits most of the time.  I will say this mat is far superior to a plastic mat on carpet, however, since those develop depressions under each chair castor making it hard to get the chair moving.  This mat doesn't have that problem, but isn't as stiff as I wish it were.  Considering it is a roll-up mat, it is very sturdy though and is the best solution I've found for moving my chair with ease over the carpet.  After two years of regular use, it is a bit scuffed up, but still looks good and still does the job.This large size is good if you need to move around to filing cabinets and printers.  The projection in front keeps the chair from rolling off the mat when it is pushed up close to the desk.  That's important because when the chair is partly rolled off the mat, it's not easy to get it back on if the chair is heavy and you can't do it at all while you're seated.  The `step up' onto the mat when it's on carpet is almost half an inch.  The mat is not that thick, but the pile of the carpet and the roll-up structure of the mat tends to raise the edges a bit.I recommend the mat highly for use on a hard floor surface that one is trying to protect and with reservations for use on padded carpet.  In that setting, it isn't perfect but better than the alternatives I've tried so far.",4,Better on hard floor than carpet,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",285,32,33,0.96969697,helpful

940879,A10J2WJBGTDMKK,B005IVL0ZK,AshKask,"[88, 101]","I have had this printer for over a month now.  I purchased this printer because it seemed like it was a good deal.  I am a student and have to print quite a few documents and articles.  Knowing what I know now, I would have paid a little extra money to get a much better printer.  I strongly advise against this printer.  I apologize for the long review, but I hope this will be helpful to others. Here are some cons that I have run into so far:1.  The printer does not pick up a wireless signal from my router unless the router is sitting on top of the scanner.  I had it sitting ~ 2 feet away on a table, and it would not pick up the signal.2.  I usually like to print things in the ""draft"" quality because it saves money with ink and it's much faster.  I had an hp photosmart printer (C4180 model) before this one, and the draft quality for standard documents was just as good as the normal quality.  However, with this printer, I could barely read the draft quality; therefore, I am having to waste A LOT of ink.  In fact, the ""fast draft"" option for my hp printer is 100 times better than the draft option for this printer.  If my hp printer were wireless I would throw this one out and just keep using that one.3.  The 126 cartridge claims it will print 385 pages with black ink.  I have no idea where they got this from, because I have printed approximately 200 pages (or less) in a month, and I just had to switch out my black ink.  Basically, I'm not even half way through a ream of paper yet since I've had this printer.  This problem wouldn't be as much of an issue if the draft quality was legible.  The black ink cartridge with my hp printer would last for months.  I could usually get through close to two reams of paper (almost 1,000 pages) with my hp printer.4.  The printer interrupts it's current print job to make you replace an ink cartridge.  I usually try to use every bit of ink I can since all printers are notorious for giving you the low ink warning, when in reality you have plenty of ink to last you for a while longer.  I had the low ink sign for only a few days, and although the last page it printed was not the least bit faded, it would not complete the document until I changed the ink cartridge.5.  Because I have to print in regular quality, the printing is incredibly slow.  It often has to ""take a break,"" so to speak, in the middle of printing a 5 page word document.6.  When I was attempting to set up the wireless printing for the first time, I tried to contact them through their email service, but did not get a response from them.  The next day, I called them and was able to speak to an epson employee.  However, she hung up on me before my problem was resolved.  (The problem was that the printer was not picking up a wireless signal even though the router was next to the printer).  From other reviews I have read about epson customer service employees, this is not uncommon.Pros:1.  It has airprint capabilities for the iPad.  I have tried this a few times, and it takes probably a good 3-4 minutes to print one page from the iPad.  I don't know how quick other airprint printers are when printing from the iPad though.2.  It has a scanner, but so do a lot of other much better printers.3.  It's wireless...sometimes.4.

One good thing about the cardboard; it is pre bended and even provides lines edging the leaflet and back.

The physical design of the cartridge is similar but different than the OEM cartridges.  They do not have the rubber real on the bottom, but a plastic barrier that is pierced by the printer upon insertion.  Problems may arise with the plastic getting caught inside the piercing portion and becoming a blockage to ink flow.  This will likely ruin the printer as it will be irremovable.I also have found a way to deal with them when they stop working, or don't work to begin with.-At first I thought the plunger on the top was going to pump ink into the bottom cavity where the printer pulls from, so I pumped it for a while but nothing happened.-Upon further investigation I speculated that the printer pumps air into the cartridge through the plunger, and it pushes ink into the printer. This was confirmed after I cut a cartridge open for inspection.-I attempted to blow into the cartridge to force ink into the bottom reservoir.  This did not work.Solution:I put the cartridge into the printer and told it to clean the cartridge.  It then pumped air into it and completed.

The cost of the toner cartridges is about the same with other printers I've seen.What comes in the box:Printer, drum and toner assembly, AC power cord, paper Quick Setup Guide, CD-ROM.  The CD-ROM has the drivers, entire Owner's Manual, and animated installation guide.Note:  No cables are provided.If you are going to connect the printer to a wireless router, you will need an Ethernet cable.If you are going to connect the printer directly to one computer, you will need either a USB or parallel cable.  The printer has connections for both.SetupThe setup did not go as easily as I hoped.I had two problems with installation and setup:1) I was not sure which network to use (peer to peer or shared).2) After installation, I could not print from one of the two computers on the network.After easily removing some shipping adhesive tape, inserting the drum/toner assembly (looks like a full toner cartridge, not a starter cartridge) and paper tray, I was ready to proceed with installing the software drivers.The Quick Setup Guide presents you with choices for Windows 98/Me/2000/XP:  USB interface, parallel interface, and network interface.  There are also choices if using Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Macintosh.  The manufacturer's website indicates Microsoft Vista has ""built-in"" drivers but Brother drivers are also available on the website.Upon clicking ""Install Printer Driver"" from CD-ROM menu, I was presented with three choices: USB cable users, Parallel cable users, and Network cable users.  I chose the network cable users since I wanted to add the printer to my wireless network router.  I was presented with a license agreement that I accepted.  I then had to choose between ""Brother Peer-to-Peer Network Printer"" or ""Network Shared Printer"".  I chose peer-to-peer to print directly to the printer over the network rather than to a central server on a shared printer.  On Step 8 I had to choose ""LPR"" or ""NetBios"".  I had no idea which one to choose and I didn't find any useful information to help with the decision.  I chose LPR and clicked Next.  The printer was recognized.  Make sure to write down the IP Node Address (for a wireless router it is something like 192.xxx.xx.x).Now, I needed to access the printer from my wireless computer running Microsoft Vista.  I went to the Control Panel and double clicked on Printers.  I then chose ""Add a Printer"" and selected ""Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer"".  The computer searched for and found the printer.  A couple more clicks and I was successfully printing from the wireless computer.Printing from the desktop computer running Windows XP, connected to the router with an Ethernet cable, would not be as simple.  The computer recognized the printer but would not send any data to the printer.  I went to Control Panel, Printer and Faxes, right clicked on Properties.  The General tab did not have the Location of the printer.  I added 192.xxx.xx.x and clicked OK and tried printing a document but I was not successful.  After two hours of dealing with it and looking at the company's website, I called the company (toll-free phone number right on the box).  The company was closed; I called the next morning just after the company opened at 9 a.m. Eastern.  I went through a very brief voice prompt menu and I was connected to Robby in all of about two minutes.  He was polite but he was not able to solve my problem.  He told me second level support would call me within 24 hours.  Just over two hours later I got a call from Debbie, who was in Memphis, Tennessee.  She was very helpful and quickly identified the problem.  When hovering over the printer icon in the Printer and Faxes folder, the little popup message indicated the printer was offline.  I don't know how I missed that.  To correct the problem all I had to do was right click the printer and select ""Use Printer Online"".  After a few seconds the printer was in Ready status.  Problem resolved.SummaryThis is my first Brother printer and I am very favorably impressed.  I don't think there is another printer on the market with these features at such a low price, at least at the time of this writing.The product is shipped in the manufacturer's box, not an Amazon box, so all your neighbors will know what's in the box on your doorstep.  The box looks like the box for a new printer, listing many features of the printer but it is clearly marked ""Factory Refurbished"".  The printer itself has a sticker on the back with ""Re-manufactured Product"".  My printer was originally manufactured in September 2005.  I bought it in May 2007.My experience with Brother International has been very positive.  I got a great printer with excellent features, a full-size toner cartridge TN-550 (not a starter toner cartridge!), and a one-year warranty.  From idle/sleep, the first page took only 20 seconds to print and the text quality is great.  The icing on the cake was the technical support provided by Americans.  Their promptness and knowledge was impressive.  This was easily the best technical support experience I have ever had!Update December 4, 2007:I am still very pleased with the printer but it is noisy when printing and it does make ""tick, tick, tick"" noises sometimes.  Neither of these issues has effected performance.  The only annoyance I've experienced is with envelope printing - the envelope always crinkles.  This isn't a big deal for me but it is something to consider if envelope printing is important to you.Update October 7, 2008:I purchased another refurbished HL-5250.  The toner and drum are also factory refurbished.  The drum unit (DR-520) has life expectancy of 22,500 pages, about 90% of new.  The toner cartridge (TN-550) has an expected yield of 3,150 pages at 5% coverage.

Then Click ""Set..."" and check the ""Enable ICM"" box.  In this window, you can also fine-tune color balance settings although I've never had any luck here.3) Good points about Canon printers:  they seem to use ink sparingly and the separate ink tanks are nice.  They're fast.  The resolution is great - even on my s820 prints you'd be hard-pressed to see dots or banding.  The photo prints are glossy throughout just like ""real"" photos.

Until I read the specs on this product, I was *strongly* against printing digital photos at home for 2 reasons:  1) durability.  If you have ever tried to scrapbook digital photos, you know that the ink is not permanent, and I highly encouraged people to take their digital pictures to a lab for pictures that would last longer.  2) cost.  Before this product, printing photos at home was cost prohibitive.  With the cost of ink and paper, it was far more economical to send to an online developer or your local lab.The Epson Picture Mate overcomes these obstacles.  Read the specs.  They're awesome.  I scrapbook to preserve my photos for generations and this product lasts longer than those printed from a lab!  Up to 200 years in a photo safe memory album.  And at twenty-nine cents a picture (twenty-four cents if you buy your paper from Amazon), it is roughly the same as sending your photos out, but this is more convenient and will last longer!If you want your pictures to last generations, if you want to preserve them for long-term, this is a great printer!

Every student should have one of these.  Period.  It takes all of the strain out of reading large books.  There is no more hunching over a desk or trying to hold a heavy book at a comfortable angle.  I've tested it at both ends of its range of standing angles and it is perfectly stable across the board.I also tested its stability with the plus attachment and my text book on the top part.  For that, the steepest (most vertical) setting does not work because it causes the attachment to actually be pitched forward.  However, with the angle of the main piece being set such that the attachment is not more than vertical, it is completely stable.  I was nicely surprised to find that the plus attachment can be used as a stand-alone book stand.  Buying the stand and attachment together basically gives you a second book stand for $20.As far as the construction and hardware are concerned, it is lightweight, but not to the point of feeling cheap.  The little arms that hold pages down have a nice amount of pressure, enough to hold an 800+ page paperback textbook vertically, but not so much that they are in danger of marking the pages.  The stand is a thick plastic that is solidly attached to the face.  The stand itself is made of a wood veneer, but it looks very nice.One thing that I found to be odd, and probably what caused other customers to say that it is unstable, is the way the stand works.  The plastic part of the stand has small rubber grips on one  side that very much makes it look as though it is meant to be the part that is in contact with the desk.  In addition, there are grooves on the side opposite of the rubber that look like they are meant to be resting places for the stand's face.  While it can be used in this configuration, it has a narrow range of usable angles and is not very stable at all.  Instead, I recommend setting it up such that the stand forms an upside down ""U"" with respect to the desk and the ""bottom"" of the stand is facing away from the stand itself.  To get a visual of what I mean, take a look at the images provided by the seller and find the one that shows the the stand in three configurations with the stand circled in blue.  The top right configuration is what appears to be the ""correct"" way to set it up and is completely unstable.  The top left configuration is the way that I use it.  If you look at the image titled &lt;COMPARISON - SUPPORT BOARDS>, you can see both the unstable configuration and a series of ridges on the stand's arm.  When the stand is set up in the way that I recommend, each one of those grooves represents a usable stand angle and it really is stable at every one of them.  Once I worked that out, I had no trouble with the stand at all.",5,A must have for frequent readers of heavy books,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",539,13,13,1,helpful

I've gone through a handful of chunky erasers, several packs of lead, dozens of reams of paper, two and a half years of graduate school, and three actuarial exams since then and they're both still going strong. I was just putting pencil lead on my list of things to pick up when I started to reflect on how awesome these are.I felt that I really ought to do something to show the company my appreciation. I haven't had the opportunity to be a repeat customer because it seems that two is a lifetime supply. So I hope that this review helps them sell a couple extra packs.A friend that I studied with a couple of years ago used cheap plastic Bics which he bought by the sack (literally). They didn't grip the lead well, the tip broke frequently, and the pencils usually failed before they ran out of lead. They probably averaged about ten hours of use which means that he was going through about one a day. There's no doubt that my two Zebra M-301s have gone through several THOUSAND hours of use, and like I said, functionally, they seem as good as new. The lead never slips, rarely breaks, and I've had maybe a dozen jams in that entire period (which were easily corrected).One of the most outstanding products I have ever purchased.

The flags apply easily and remove easily, just like regular Post-It Notes.

I have made a cross reference and indicated A on blue = Topic #1, B on yellow = Topic #2, C on red indicates Topic #3, etc.  The other difficulty is that there is little room to write on these flags, so they are more useful for indicating than writing.  I have also used regular Post-It notes as flags when I need to make a note about a particular passage.These flags are also useful if you want to mark other things, such as unread books on the shelf, the location of various types of recipes, or to remind yourself that there is an item to be taken care of (such as flagging a tool that needs returned to the garage toolbox).

759670,A30931K3W8ASPL,B003Z4173C,K. Mui,"[12, 12]","TL;DR: Got the white chair. Looks nice, but the leather is fake and feels cheaply made overall. Ended up returning these chairs for an actual Eames chair. You can check out the side-by-side comparisons I uploaded in the customer images.One day, you find yourself in need of a chair for your office. Not a plasticky, bulky, ergo monstrosity but one that exudes style, fitting with the clean lines of your new contemporary furniture. And then you find it: Eames Aluminum Group (EAG) chair. Lithe outlines. Sleek metal hardware. Soft yet sturdy leather upholstery. You're gonna be like a boss.Alas, priced at 10x your budget, you realize that owning this chair would be a pipe dream. That is, until you got here. The LexMod Ribbed Midback (LRM) Office Chair! Is it a suitable alternative to that Herman Miller chair you wanted? Let's take a look.- Cost (8/10)A build to order EAG management chair starts at $1329. With all the options on the LRM (leather, pneumatic lift, tilt limiter, casters) and you're looking at $2039. The LRM is a whopping 87.8% less at $248. No big surprise, that's what we come to expect when we're shopping for ""Nolex"" watches. However, you could also get a nice office chair from IKEA for $200, so not quite a steal unless you had to have this style.- Style (9/10)From 10' away, this chair is gorgeous and is quite a close replica. The major departures are below.Seat material: Stitched ribs, instead of pressed ribsMetal hardware: Mirror finish, instead of greyish polished metalTilt: Tension knob oriented forward, instead of reversePneumatic Lift: Shiny round knob, instead of flat paddle. EAG also has a hood on the piston assemblySeat position: Flat and straight, while the EAG has a pronounced ""pocket"" and leans back slightlyThese differences don't detract from the LRM, but I do prefer the look of pressed ribs- Materials and Build Quality (2/10)The chair is lightweight and feels rather sturdy. Only time can tell how the material ages. There are a few glaringly disappointing construction decisions. LexMod, why oh why do you cheap out where it matters?!Leather: Instead of the soft, smooth, supple embrace you would expect from genuine leather, the LRM's ""genuine italian leather"" feels like a pencil eraser; spongy and rubbery. Flipping over the sewn edge of the seat reveals a fabric backing that can only be one thing, artificial leather. It wouldn't have been such a disappointment if the product description just says what it is. Note that this is not a packaging defect. The nice folks at Amazon customer service tried replacing this chair with another one from their inventory, but I could see it was the same material with a quick peek in the second box.Plastic bits: On the EAG, the only plastic bits are the casters wheels themselves. LRM has made a couple of fatal mistakes when it came to material substitution. The tilt tension knob is the most egregious swap. On the EAG, the robust and smooth knob are among the small details that make the chair so elegant. On the LRM, you have this hollowed cap with an adjustment screw shaded with a poorly cut plastic tube for routing wires. Small detail, but screams cheap nonetheless. Same goes with the pneumatic lift knob, caster covers, and end caps on the chair support chassis. All plastic chunks with a cheap feeling shiny chrome coating.At the end of the day, it comes down to how you balance cost, style, and quality. If you want reasonably priced style, you will be satisfied with the LRM. Personally, I wanted a higher quality chair and opted to get an EAG outright. Provided Amazon still supports it, please take a look at some of my pictures to see the differences between the LRM and EAG side by side.",2,Cheap imitation is cheap,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",632,12,12,1,helpful

Reason for upgrading, couldn't keep the epson's printhead from clogging.  Wasted more ink trying to keep the printheads clean then I actually used printing pictures.  As far as print quality goes between the two is basically a toss up.  Prints from the canon are more glossy then the epson probably due to the fact the canon uses dye inks while the epson uses pigment.  The only thing I don't like about the canon is right out of the box the prints seem to have to much red in them.  Playing around in Adobe CS4 I was able to get the prints to my liking.  With the easyprint software included with the printer, no matter what setting it seemed all the pictures have a red tint to them.  This is one area the epson had an advantage, the easyprint software that came with the epson produced prints spot on.  This is the reason I gave the printer a four star instead of five.  The people that use adobe photoshop to print all their pictures won't have a problem, but people like me that like using the easyphoto program to print out a bunch of picutres might be somewhat disappointed.

I was mainly looking for a decent scanner with duplexing capability to scan the family records we have to PDF (which is a mountain of paper).  I was also fed up with inkjet printers because we don't print much and with our past printers, the ink cartridges (usually nearly full) would dry up between printing.  The black&white; (gray-scale) laser printer does a great job for home use.A great additional feature is the networking capability.  Since our home was pre-wired for a home network, although I am new to networking of any kind, I found the installation and setup easy to follow and it went pretty much without a hitch.  I have a 2 TB Western Digital network storage device (NAS) attached to the network.  We use a router that also offers wireless connections.  So now the entire family can print directly to the printer from any device (with a printing capability) connected to the home network.  Also, the DCP-8085dn can be set up to scan to a folder on the network.  I chose to set up a scans folder on the NAS, so I don't have to use a PC to make a scan.  I can walk up to the DCP-8085dn and place a stack of papers in the document feeder, hit a few buttons to access presets that I set up, hit the green start button and walk away.  When done I can have image files or PDF's waiting for me in the scans folder.A few notes:(1) Even though it might look like one from the picture, this isn't one of those huge Ricoh or Canon copier/scanners like one might find in an office setting that can scan 100 sheets front and back in a matter of a couple minutes at a decent DPI.  It is smaller and slower.  But for home use and for the price, I think it's perfectly acceptable.(2) The DCP-8085dn does not have a fax capability.  But instead you get full duplex capability when copying, scanning and printing.  Since I never send or receive faxes at home, this wasn't even a consideration for me.(3) DUPLEX SCANNING NOTE:  ALTHOUGH THE SCANNING GLASS IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SCAN LEGAL DOCUMENTS (8.5"" x 14""), WHEN USING THE DOCUMENT FEEDER IN DUPLEX MODE, YOU CAN'T SCAN DOCUMENTS MUCH LARGER THAN LETTER SIZED (8.5"" x 11"").  IF YOU PLAN TO SCAN A DOCUMENT WITH PAGES LONGER THAN 11"", YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES:  USE THE DOCUMENT FEEDER BUT ONLY SCAN ONE-SIDED, THEN REDO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOCUMENT ONE-SIDED OR DO IT MANUALLY ON THE FLATBED.  THIS WAS ACTUALLY A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME, SINCE THE DCP-8085dn CAN HANDLE LENGTHY MULTI-PAGE LEGAL DOCUMENTS WITHOUT A PROBLEM MANUALLY.  Although I'm not certain, I suspect that the issue has to do with the available space the document feeder has to flip a page over.  Any thing up to 11"" in length can be flipped over, but anything longer can't.  If you decide to scan a double-sided document one side at a time, you will need software to edit PDF pages to put them in order.  This has not been a deal breaker for me, as most documents I have a letter sized or smaller.  But it might not be suitable for someone looking to scan loads of legal sized documents.(4) SCAN QUALITY NOTE:  ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT FEEDER'S QUALITY IS ACCEPTABLE FOR MY ARCHIVING PURPOSES, IT TENDS TO WARP THE IMAGE SLIGHTLY.  SCANNED PAGES (VIA THE DOCUMENT FEEDER) TEND TO HAVE A CURVE OR BOW DOWN THE PAGE.  IF I WANT A REALLY GOOD SCAN I HAVE TO MANUALLY SCAN USING THE FLATBED.  WHEN USING THE FLATBED, I DON'T GET THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE CURVE/BOW.  SO, IF YOU NEED AN EXACT COPY WITHOUT DISTORTION, YOU'LL NEED TO MANUALLY SCAN AND NOT USE THE DOCUMENT FEEDER.  For my purposes, the convenience of the document feeder outweighs the acceptable slight distortion it produces over standing at that the DCP-8085dn and manually scanning documents.Over all, I am extremely pleased with the DCP-8085dn.  I have been using the scanner like crazy working on eliminating that mountain of paper.  It's slow progress, but I'm getting there thanks to the DCP-8085dn.I recommend the DCP-8085dn to anyone looking for a home-use scanner with duplexing capabilities (except as noted above).  It's a good printer and copier, too.  Furthermore, the networking is a bonus that you should take advantage of if you can.",5,Workhorse for Home Office & Family Use,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",751,16,16,1,helpful
277687,A2U83VDVJMAB2U,B000MAQWIW,Brian Baker,"[28, 30]","As a former professional photographer, a printer's performance as a photo processor is really where the rubber meets the road. Let's face it, in this day and age, almost any multi-function unit from a reputable manufacturer will do a good job on the typical uses of faxing, printing and scanning documents, and that sort of thing. But how will they perform as photo printers?I shoot Nikon pro-level cameras and lenses, both film and digital. I have a Canon 9950F dedicated print scanner, a Nikon CoolScan negative/slide scanner, and an HP 8750 as a dedicated printer for larger format photo prints. I use Photoshop, Lightroom, DNG Converter, and other top-end photo software. The quality of my photo prints is absolutely crucial to me artistically.What I wanted was a printer that would allow me to print standard size prints -- 4X6 and 5X7 -- without having to run them through my 8750, while still getting lab quality prints in an archival medium.The 7580 fills the bill admirably. It uses the Vivera inks, which on HP's Premium Plus papers will last for over 100 years. That was a vast improvement over my Canon i9900, which though it was a fine printer that yielded excellent images, those images could be expected to start fading in a pretty short period of time. That was simply unacceptable to me.Image quality, as I wrote, is as good as one gets from a lab. As a photo scanner, it will be more than adequate for the vast majority of users, with a good interface. Scan qualities can be improved through the use of Photoshop, Lightroom, or many other available software programs.I will say that once I get to print sizes of 8X10 and up, there's a (to me) noticeable difference in the quality of the finished product between my 7580 and my 8750. But at smaller sizes, the differences in quality will be unnoticeable to all but the most demanding, and even at 8X10 the average viewer probably wouldn't notice the difference in quality.I have to say, I love this printer, and strongly recommend it.",5,"Terrific printer, especially for photos",1196294400,"11 29, 2007",347,28,30,0.933333333,helpful

It is economical with it's use of the ""printing film"" (for copies and faxes).  Of course, the more you fax and copy, the sooner it will run out.I've purchased 4 additional ""remote hand sets"" (Quantity:2 of KXTGA520M and quantity:2 of KXTGA523M).  I also purchased the Headset KXTCA92) as well for my office.I've owned this system for 10 months and everything works flawlessly!  Calls are crystal clear; Conference works great; it stores over 30 ""missed"" calls (I usually delete them when there is that many).  I've only replaced the replaceable film once.  I'd say that I fax and copy maybe twice a week.  The battery life on all of the phones is excellent.  I've had conference calls lasting up to 5 hours (thank god for the headset) and the battery still listed 3 full bars after I hung up.There is a nice backlight to see who's calling.  There is also a nice female digital voice that reads off who is calling when the phone rings. This feature may seem trivial, but it works at every handset throughout the house so you don't have to be near the ""main terminal"" to hear it.  If the caller does not allow caller ID, but allow their call number to display, the female voice says ""number available"" but does not read the number.  If their ""name"" comes up, it will read the name and gets it pronounced correctly about 85% of the time.  For example, a phone call from ""Dan & Angela Dickens"" is pronounced correctly but a call from ""UNICOM"" is pronounced ""u-ni-come"" instead of U-NI-COM.Here's the one drawback: When someone like a telemarketer calls and you see that it's from an ""888"" number, you can hit the ""off"" button which stops that particular phone from ringing any further.  However, it does not stop ALL of the other phones from continuing to ring.  As I said, I purchased 4 other handsets scattered throughout the house so you can hear the other phones ringing after you hit the ""off"" button.  A minor annoyance I've found to be a small mark on the overall feature set.The distance allowed from the ""main terminal"" is also excellent.  I've been on conference calls and walked to my mailbox outside which is about 700 feet away with no loss or degredation of signal.  I am not sure what the manufacturer specifications are but I believe that is plenty for just about any household or small office.To summarize, I've owned 3 of these types of ""all in one"" phone systems over the past 10 years and this model (and it's accessories) are top notch!

The Canon works well (and works VERY well with my Macs) but it has started to print slowly and I've always wanted to get a printer that had a bit more economical print costs (the Canon burns through ink tanks quickly and they are very expensive for the number of pages you get) as well as the ability to print from my growing number of Apple iDevices (it's a bit of a novelty, but there have been times I'm doing something on the iPad and would like to print a receipt or hard copy).I narrowed my search down to this Epson Workforce 845, or one of the HP multi-functions.  As I've had very bad luck with HP drivers and support in the past, I decided to purchase the WorkForce 845 since a local retailer had it on sale for the very reasonable price of $140... I was leery though because I had read many mixed things about Mac support from Epson.Well, it turns out those fears are well founded.  I have a relatively new iMac running OS X 10.7 Lion.  My wife has a Macbook Pro 17"" running OS X Snow Leopard.Initially I was pretty happy... setting the printer up was relatively easy (I just added the printer when it was discovered on the network and let OS X do the rest) and was up and running in no time.  I let OS X download and install the latest available drivers for the printer.The problems began when I wanted to do anything other than basic print and scan with the printer... for example, make use of the ""scan to PC"" and ""scan to PC PDF"" buttons on the front of the printer.  I've always used these functions on the Canon and find them fairly indispensable.  When I choose scan to PC on the WorkForce I simply get a choice for USB.  I figured that I must simply be missing the needed software, so I downloaded the full software package from Epson and installed everything as well as updated the printer firmware to the latest version.Still no choice for printing to the Mac from the Epson.  Also, I observed that the Epson scan package is very very primitive compared to what Canon makes available for their printers (Canon has a full scan/print/edit management suite called MPX Navigator that works FANTASTICALLY).I finally broke down and called tech support.  The tech support guy tried to be helpful, but right from the start he acknowledged that the Epson software does not work fully with OS X 10.6 or 10.7.  What?  I can maybe see cutting a manufacturer a bit of slack for not supporting a new OS that's less than a year old, but SL has been out for 2.5 years at this point.What's even more mind boggling is that Epson clearly wants to court the Apple crowd by providing AirPrint support for iOS devices, but can't be bothered with providing full function support for Macs?  You know, the Apple devices that might actually do a decent volume of printing in your average home?The phone rep told me that the package needed for the network print to work is called Epson Event Manager.  I asked him why this was not included in the large ""complete"" download of all of the software for the 845 and he told me ""well, there are still problems with Event Manager under SL and Lion"".The rep walked me through downloading and installing this software, which promptly crashed on my Mac.  Additionally, when it IS running, and I try to print from the panel of the Epson WorkForce I eventually get a message indicating ""communication error occurred"".  The rep tried a few things and then sort of stammered out that it does work for some Mac users, and not others, and it has to do with how the Epson software got installed/upgraded or how OS X got installed/upgraded.  He honestly sounded thoroughly confused.  What's more, it did not work on EITHER Mac in the house, which sort of shoots some holes in the idea that there's something wrong with my particular box causing the trouble.I also observed that even after following the Fax setup functions, the printer doesn't seem to be able to Fax from my Macs, even though I can fax directly from the front panel just fine.All in all it seems as though Epson delegates Mac support completely to the back burner and it takes them months, if not years, to fix issues, if they ever do.  Also, comparing the software packages that are included from Canon to those that Epson includes is a bit of a laugh.  The Epson stuff just flat out looks archaic compared to what Canon had on the market almost three years ago.The saddest part about all of this is that for just straight up printing and scanning (from the PC with the scan app) the printer works pretty well... but, in all likelihood I will be returning it, because without full Mac support, I can't really keep this machine.",2,Not very good for Macs,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",864,23,28,0.821428571,helpful

But before I could get to a technician to complete the setup (message was that the printer was offline even though it was on my network and I had confirmed the successful setup by printing a page to tell me that), I was on hold one evening for over THREE HOURS!!!  And I have iPhone screen shots to prove it, which I may try to figure out how to attach to this review.  It was just unbelievable.  Finally at 11:43pm I decided that even if I were lucky enough to ever have an HP tech respond, I was too tired to go through any sort of diagnostics with him/her.I called the next day, and after a MERE 48 minutes on hold, a tech answered.  He's the one who figured out they had sent me the wrong model.  FYI, there are three different models of this printer.  I believe they're all A909, but there's an 'A' 'G' and 'N' series.  You can tell which one you have easily by opening the print cartridge door.  There's a sticker on the part of the door that folds down.I received my second replacement printer today, November 5th, and could not get it even to the alignment stage.  After 48 minutes on hold my call was somehow disconnected, so I decided to try live chat.  After a considerable wait of 30-45 minutes, a live chat tech rep finally responded.  We went through thing after thing for over two hours, and still could not get rid of the ""paper jam"" message, which is exactly what the problem was with the original printer.Be aware that when HP sends you the replacement printer, they send the bare minimum:  You have to remove everything that's removable, and one piece that you wouldn't think is removable; the faceplate.  I believe the duplexer part may be the problem, but after two hours on chat, the result of that was ""We'll have a hardware technician call you within an hour.""  It's been over an hour and no call.I loved this printer while it worked, but the honeymoon is over, and I'm seriously considering divorce :-)UPDATE, NOVEMBER 19TH - It has indeed been ""third time charm,"" at least thus far.  The third replacement printer has been working satisfactorily, although this one did have a couple of very tiny thin scratches on the black shiny portion on the front of the printer, so I'm afraid this one may have been a store display or something along those lines.  I would not change any of the above comments, but I might raise the review to 1.5 stars.  I still would be very cautious about HP in the future, unless I can buy from Sams Club or Costco, somewhere locally with an excellent return policy.UPDATE 2, FEB 11th, 2010 - Still working like it should.  It's a 5-star printer when working properly.  I'd up my review to 3.5 to 4 stars at this point, now that the frustrations mentioned above have had time to fade.  Another ""pro"" of note:  It doesn't seem to be near the ink hog that some printers are.UPDATE 3, JAN 8th, 2012 - Paper jam issues continue.  Cheaply made.  It was giving me a weird code for some unspecified reason about the print carriage not being able to move, although it moved normally.  I took it to a printer repair depot, and just today was advised that a plastic part is cracked which will cause the ""paper jam"" code to appear, as well as a mylar carrier strap being broken.  The repair estimate was $85.  I decided to recycle this one and move on to an Epson Artisan, which was on sale for only $99, along with a Canon PIXMA all-in-one printer and a Canon PIXMA Pro 9500 Mark II that had an excellent rebate over the holidays.  I, like many others, am done with HP.",1,Not ready for prime time .... at least until you get your 3rd replacement!,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",860,24,24,1,helpful

Quick and easy.Once you're done scanning your pictures, you can just easily pull out the memory card and put it in your computer (I have a Mac so have that capability with SD cards).

I think they usually last for about an hour and a half/two hours of continuous scanning (like while watching tv or something) before the batteries die out.That got a little annoying since I had so many pictures and just wanted to keep scanning them.

The base unit is set up at one end of the first floor of my home, but I can take a handset anywhere in the house (even the basement or second floor) and get good reception.  I do not recall ever hearing any static or other interference.  The speakerphone in each handset works surprisingly well, considering the relatively small size and light weight of the handsets.The information packaged with the phone states that it is expandable up to six handsets and that there is an alarm clock on each handset (features which we have not yet used.)  Any entry made into the phone book in one handset is automatically duplicated in the phonebook of the other handset.  Also, the ringer on one handset can be turned off - - just set it to ""Night Mode,"" one of the Menu selections.  While the unit lacks an answering machine (which we do not need since our phone company provides voicemail), a light flashes on each handset, when there is a voicemail message that has not been retrieved.  These are all convenient features.My only complaint is that the only Quick Start guide packaged with the phone set was entirely in Spanish, making it totally useless to me.  (The more complete Operating Instructions were in English.)  In fairness, I should state that I bought this phone set from a local ""big box"" retailer, not Amazon.UPDATE: 10/27/2010 - After using these phones for a little more than two years, I began to have problems with the handset that had the most use.  At first, it would spontaneously disconnect from a call when the speakerphone was on.  Finally, the low battery signal sounded after a 10 minute conversation and when the batteries had just been fully charged.I then purchased new AAA rechcargeable batteries and installed them in the handset.  We have been using the new batteries for about two weeks and have not had any problems since then.In the course of shopping for new batteries, I noticed that the ""Panasonic"" OEM batteries that came with the phone set are marked ""630 mAh"" -- this number was on the low side of the mAh number for new replacement AAA rechargeable batteries which were available.  I purchased a replacement battery that was marked ""1,000 mAh.""  My research showed that ""mAh"" means ""milliampere-hour"" but I was unable to determine whether the higher mAh number means that the new batteries will last longer or perform better than the original batteries with a lower mAh number.  I was disappointed that the batteries that came with this phone lasted for only two years.  We have had cordless phones where the batteries lasted much longer.

It's so tiring to rip up paper with sensitive information on it into bits and pieces! So I did some research online on the models that I had an interest in and went out to the physical stores and did a price comparison.I came across the B&D; CC800 at Walmart and it was priced at only $59.88. I noticed that it had the power boost feature which seemed quite interesting. This was around the price that I was willing to spend, so I purchased it. With tax, it came out to be only $64.52 and I didn't have to wait for it to be shipped to me.I went home, opened up the box and it had a really appealing looking to it compared to the ugly one that they had on sale at Office Max for $39.99 and that thing did the ugly diamond cuts. Yuck!So I read the instruction and then test-drive my new paper shredder. It sounded just as loud as my Fellowes shredder that suddenly died one day after releasing out a burnt smell. Even though it says 8 sheets, I am not going to overwork my shredder. Because I really want it to last this time! So I'll rest my shredder and use it more sparingly this time.PROS: Nice and elegant look to it. The protective lid and power boost are such great features on this machine. It does the beautiful cross cut shreds and it does the job!CONS: It would have been better if the lid popped up by itself all the way instead of us having to lift it and move it to its position. The slit to put the paper in seems rather small, but I guess you'll get the hang of it once you get used to it.Overall, it's a really nice paper shredder by Black & Decker! I would recommend it to anybody that's on a budget and needs a paper shredder that can get the job done. If you'll be shredding a lot of paper all day long, then you should consider forking out the money and getting something that's more heavy duty. I would say that this is more of a medium duty shredder.

I use it from time-to-time to shred my unwanted junk mail. I don't know if Amazon is still offering this model or not. But if my memory serves me right, they still sell it at Walmart. So far no buyer's remorse yet in making this purchase.Just like with everything in this life, if you treat it with respect, it will most likely last for a very long time. Even machines need rest! Come to think of it, my router and DSL modem stays on all year round. The only time they're off is when the electric goes out and that's about it. Now those things are real workhorses! Let's just say, they're an exception to the norm.Anyways, with the recent merger of Stanley and Black & Decker, you now have two household brands that you can trust for many years to come. Hopefully, they'll keep both brand names around just like HP & Compaq did!See you on the other side of the New Year--the beginning of new decade!

You're the best!UPDATE [2-24-2010]:To better inform you on whether you should purchase this shredder or some other brand, I have uploaded some sample shreds for you to observe. The paper shredder used as the comparison to the CC800 was the Embassy TQ101Bc. The TQ101Bc does the diamond cuts versus the CC800's confetti cut. As far as security goes, both are decent shredders in their respective price point ranges. But if you want that extra security, you might want to look at another shredder that does even tinier shreds than these models. Price? The TQ101Bc retails at $50, but was purchased as a closeout for only $25. The CC800 was purchased at Walmart for $65 and retails on Amazon for $70.UPDATE [10-4-2011]:My CC800 still works after over two years of owning it and Walmart continues to sell this exact model at most of its stores. If this shredder is not worthy, then why would Walmart continue selling it after all these years?

And the wireless setup is very, very easy.  In addition to fast wireless printing from my PC, it also prints wirelessly from my iPad Mini. The MX922 is also a very beautifully designed machine.  I was using a MX860, which I thought printed beautiful color photos until I printed out the same photo on that machine and on my new MX922.  The MX922 printed significantly richer colors.  I do have some complaints though they are not serious enough to make me wish I had not purchased the MX922.  First, the LCD is not a touch screen, which seems a bit bit archaic at this point, especially compared to competitors' comparable AIOs.  My other complaints are the lack of a rear paper tray and the annoying process of loading legal size paper.  Unlike the MX860, which allowed you load both legal size paper AND envelopes easily into the rear tray and letter size paper into the lower/bottom tray, the MX922 only has two lower trays.  The upper of those two trays only accepts photo paper.  The lower tray accepts envelopes, letter size paper, and legal size paper.  Adjusting that bottom tray for legal size paper is both annoying and a bit bizarre.  I often feel like the somewhat flimsily constructed bottom tray will break while making that adjustment (which involves having to take the tray completely out of the machine and push the bottom of the tray on a button-like indentation that then lets you more fully extend the tray before you have to reinsert it). Thus, if you have to print a legal size document, a letter size cover letter, and an envelope, you will have to first put letter sized paper in the bottom tray, print out your cover letter, pull out the tray, take out the stack of letter size paper in the tray, make the aforementioned bizarre adjustment to the tray, insert legal size paper into the tray, print out your legal sized document, take the bottom tray out again, reverse the adjustment for legal size paper, adjust the tray for envelopes, print out the envelope, pull out the bottom tray yet again, adjust the tray for letter size paper, insert letter size paper, and finally once again insert the bottom tray back into the machine.  For paralegals, legal secretaries, real estate secretaries, and others who need to print out both legal and letter size documents, plus envelopes, this will be an annoying process.  Common sense does not seem to have been a priority in the design of this machine.

That's how I feel about my Brother 820CW MFC.  I keep walking in my office to stare at it.First let me say the dimensions are pleasantly small.  It's about 14x14 with the output paper tray stowed, and about 14x18 with the paper tray extended.  It's not very tall either. Compared to the behemoth dimensions of my old HP K80, it seems tiny.  It's also very stylishly designed.I knew I needed a network printer, because I moved my server to another location.  I could have gone for a wired version, but I thought, why not prepare for the future?  I might want to stick my router in a closet some day.  This thing could be sitting ANYWHERE and function as a printer.  I'm so glad I sprung for the wireless -- I have it set up wireless now, 128-bit WEP, and it's worked flawlessly so far.  I've printed and scanned some huge documents with no problems whatsoever.  Of course, my WiFi-G network is pretty stable; if you have lots of interference or overlapping networks you might have a problem.  But if that's the case I'm sure you already know that.The scanning and copying and faxing all work great.  The software is blessedly lean and simple to use while still being complete, unlike the bloatware that HP gives out.  Why does HP insist on crippling your machine?  Anyway, the Brother software is fantastic.  I can even configure it so that I press a button on the printer, and it will immediately start scanning to a (user-chosen) application on a (user-chosen) PC.  It's all simple and easily configurable.One note:  When I initially installed the software from CD, it also installed a bunch of PaperPort/OCR crap that I didn't want or need.  I later de-installed and re-installed from the downloaded distribution from Brother's website, and it didn't have that stuff in it.  Just so you know. You might want OCR; I never use it.The other ""extravagance"" was the color LCD.  I had no plans on printing photos without using my computer, so who cares, right?  Well, in addition to other neat uses (like being able to preview faxes before printing), the little color screen just seems to make the configuration and management of the whole unit so much easier and more pleasant.  The menus are well designed and let you set up the whole thing quickly and easily, even the wireless networking. Well worth the splurge, in retrospect.One other fun technote:  Brother includes a phone number to fax your registration to.  Yeah right.  But the fun thing is, they will fax you back a confirmation! -- So I was able to use that fax number to test both inbound and outbound faxes during my setup.  Fun!Another technote:  I have my network locked down with MAC-address restrictions.  I had a bit of a time trying to find the printer's MAC address until I realized I could use the LCD's menu system to print out some configuration pages, one of which contained the MAC address.  Just so you know.The multisheet feeder seems more than adequate.  I copied a stack of about 10 pages, including some that were kind of crumpled and dog-eared, and it didn't complain at all.  Also, no paper jams so far, and I'm using the dirt-cheap walmart paper.  Just make sure you fan the stack of paper before inserting it, just like it tells you...Haven't tried printing on photo paper yet, but the ""best"" quality on normal paper looks great.  I'm sure it can't compete with ""photo printers"", but if you're looking at a multi-function I'm sure you're prepared to compromise just a little...That's all.

The results when printed on photo paper are indistinguishable from a professionally developed photograph in most instances.I had some problems getting the printer to work initially; it was dead on arrival. This is where I decided I would discover what kind of company I was dealing with. I called canon and was, within five minutes, being told I would have a new printer overnighted to me. It arrived and worked beautifully.Not only did it arrive, it came with a fully paid return shipping label and instructions that I could keep all of the extra ink (around $70 worth), the extra print head, the free samples of photo paper that came with the printer etcI do have four complaints with the printer. First, I have found, that if one is printing extremes of white light on a human face, it tends to print out as a large white splotch rather than a finely graded result. The result looks somewhat like the person was heavily sweating and had a lot of glare; this is my main complaint.Second, the printer requires a USB cable to connect to your computer but does not have one packaged with it. Radioshack supplied me with one for around five dollars; surely canon could have put one in the box.Third, I have a dual boot computer that runs on windows and linux. Setting up this printer was easy in windows and the software it comes with makes it a breeze to print pictures on any size paper. However, canon has no linux support. If I had known this beforehand, I might have actually gone with an equivalent Hewlett Packard printer as HP has a lot of linux support.Fourth, the software it comes with deals only with .jpg files. If you have something in any other format, for example, you have to have a separate program that can convert it into .jpg format. These are easily available over the web, but it seems like a reasonable oversight that canon doesn't support anything else out of the box.My absolute favourite feature of this printer is the clear ink cartridges: this was what initially made me consider canon above anyone else. The fact that I can see how full the print cartridges are is a wonderfully liberating feature; I can actually SEE what's going on in there. Combined with the fact that each colour is an individual cartridge and very inexpensive, canon have a winning idea here.In summary, I have to say I am extremely pleased with my purchase. None of the above complaints is anything major, probably the worst is the lack of a USB cable which is easily correctable; I imagine you could order one through amazon so it is delivered simultaneously.",4,"very good printer and customer service, but a few oversights",1104624000,"01 2, 2005",472,30,31,0.967741935,helpful

I like the styling, fit, and comfort but feel they could make the quality better.  The first one I bought lasted less than two years before breaking where the chair sits on the pedestal shaft.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with any other part of the chair...just that one small, circular part of the chair bracket that keeps the chair attached to the shaft.  All they would need to do is make that one part stronger with slightly heavier gauge metal and slightly heavier welding, which would probably add about $3 to the cost of production, and they would have a GREAT product.

391726,AVYL562Y248JJ,B00166BD44,G. Ambrose,"[9, 11]","When I went off to college, I was given a Silver Shaeffer pen by an uncle.  It was a metal body one, with the one piece nib. I don't remember what model it was, but I knew that it was expensive from all the looks I got. It was the heaviest writing instrument I had ever held in my hand!  I held it in my hand as if I had been handed a one pound ingot of gold!  It felt good!  It was even better at writing.  Those were the days where you wrote with a pencil, or one of the Bic type ball pens that would leave a Morse Code trail of ink, and if you stopped for too long, they would leave a sticky puddle.  This was before the days of roller ball pens, and felt tip pens, etc.  I used that Shaeffer pen through out college, but after graduating, I found I had to fill in multi-part forms with carbon sheets, and checks with duplicates, which needed a ball point pen.  So my Shaeffer, through which many ounces of ink had flowed, was retired.  With all the moves I have made since then, it has been ""lost"".  Probably in one of the un-opened moving boxes from three or four moves ago that still clutter my basement.Now with copying and fax machines, laser printers, the internet, digital photography, etc.  There are less and less places that require a ""carbon"" copy of a document.  You fill one in, and then fax it, or more often, you fill it in on-line and print or e-mail the completed copies to as many people as you need to.  Because of this, it is now easier to use a fountain pen.  Modern disposable pen technology has improved to the point that a fountain pen is redundant, but all the same, you can use one in regular writing situations, like signing a check, or writing out a list, etc.  Surprisingly, it may also be more economical, with an ounce of ink going a long way.  Factoring in the cost, and longevity of one of these pens, it could become cheaper in the long run than paying $12.00 - $15.00 for 10 disposable pens.But economy is not why you use a fountain pen.  A fountain pen forces you to write with a more delicate stroke, to avoid damage to the nib.  The modulation of the force varies the width of the stroke almost imperceptibly, but still noticeable in a side by side comparison.  It forces you to form your letters better, and makes you remember those penmanship classes that you had to take!  Almost every time I take out my pen to write something, people comment on the pen.  The younger generation are fascinated, and the older ones become nostalgic, relating stories of their first or favorite fountain pen, and how it took them through school or college.This particular Shaeffer pen is similar to one I had owned in the past. It is metal bodied, with a deep black satin finish.  It does not feel slippery in your hands.  The gold accents really make it stand out.  It is a handsome pen, and something you would be proud to display. The nib is a separate piece, and you grasp the nib holder away from the ink containing parts of the nib.  This, I find works better for me, since I don't seem to get ink on my fingers as much.  The one piece nib pens tend to hold some ink away from the tip, and if you are the type who grabs the nib close to the end, your finger ends up with ink stains.  I bought ink and use the provided filler, after finishing the cartridges that came with it.  Cartridge ink is way too expensive if you plan on using this as your main writing instrument.  I would suggest Noodlers ink (Also bought on Amazon.com) which is great ink, and cheaper than Shaeffer Ink.  One fill of ink lasts me about 3 to 4 days, but it is not a big deal.  I have just made it a habit to fill up with ink before I leave home in the morning.  If I forget a day or two, I still know I won't run out.  I do carry a roller ball pen, for the odd carbon sheet form I may fill out.The packaging was very good, and protected the actual case that insturment came in.  It was promptly delivered.Buy the pen as a fashion statement, or for nostalgia, or any other reason, but it is still a great practical writing instrument, which will improve your hand writing.

Neither were as sleek or as well made as this scanner. Canon knows how to design their products to be visually appealing. The form factor on this scanner is also very nice. I love that it can be stored vertically so that it doesn't take up my entire desk when not in use.I primarily scan documents for digital filing. I dislike paper files, and generally scan in my financial statements, bills, etc. and then shred the originals. The digital versions are then retained in a bitlocked file on my home network and backed up online. I also use a scanner for photographs, but that is a rare use for me personally since I only do digital photography these days. Those that care take note--this is not a professional film scanner and will not generate good results with slides or negatives. If you want archive quality reproductions of film or slides, look elsewhere.This scanner is a workhorse for other purposes such as my application. It takes high quality, sharp scans of documents and does so very quickly. I have no complaints with the functionality of scanner. As I said, Canon knows how to make hardware. However, the software provided with the scanner leaves a lot to be desired.If you are not very familiar with scanners, you will likely find that the Canon software is easy to use and adequate for your purposes. That is because Canon has streamlined the software for newbies and made accessing the more advanced features a real pain in the rear. As a user of Canon's professional grade printers at work, I am used to having a high degree of control over settings, as well as having those setting readily available and easy to adjust. Unfortunately that is not the case with this software package--It took me nearly twenty minutes of screwing around to find the advanced features that allow for control of the histogram. Canon should have made it much easier to find the advanced features, and also should have made it possible to select them as the default. As is, each time I want to access those settings I have to go through a relatively complicated and unintuitive process.Additionally, for some reason the scanner defaults to 1200dpi as a maximum, even though the scanner is a max 4800dpi. The available drop down to make an adjustment doesn't even include DPIs higher than 1200. The user must manually type them in to access higher DPI scans. This is a poorly designed software issue and should be resolved by Canon in a future driver release (or at least I hope so).On the positive side, the footprint of the software (how much of your system resources it uses) is minimal. Thankfully it is not a massive piece of bloatware eating up RAM in the background.Overall this is a 3.5 Star product. For the price point, it is a solid scanner. I do wish that the software was better, but it is more than adequate for most people. If you just want a stable scanner that will get the job done with minimal fuss, this is a great choice. If you have more plans for your scanner than basic operations, I suggest you get a more expensive model with a fuller feature set.",4,"Good hardware, occasionally frustrating software",1286928000,"10 13, 2010",560,42,44,0.954545455,helpful

559126,A3PU2TKU7QXF3E,B00291O7A2,RWM,"[10, 12]","I bought this printer on Dec. 24th thru Amazon via [...] the actual seller. The list price was $[...] + CA tax ($3.50) so I jumped on it after already returning an Epson Stylus NX415 back to my local Staples (their sale price of $69.99) the day before because it just wouldn't print in color for whatever reason but otherwise every other function worked great. And this was after researching many printer brands and models and reading reviews etc...for days. I could careless about having the fax and wireless aspect so this Canon MP490 seemed that it should do the job for me similar to the Epson printer I returned.  Note, I already had the USB cable from my old tired Epson printer that was hard to get ink cartridges because of its old model age.Anyway, after putting this Canon printer in the cart I later checked out the [...] website out of curiosity and they were temporarily out of stock. Jeez, now what are my options and how long to get this all-in-one-printer if it is not in stock?  Also I noticed that Office Depot had it down from $49.99 to $39.99 the day after Xmas for that week until the end of the year.  So I e-mailed Amazon with my question and they got back almost immediately telling me they would on pass my e-mail to [...]. I did this on Dec. 26th and the next day [...] responded back and said they would check out the warehouse availability and get back to me.  That same day [...] e-mailed me again and said I would get a $10.00 refund because they pride themselves in customer satisfaction hence the refund.  Then on the morning of Monday Dec. 28th another e-mailed arrived from both Amazon and Buy saying the printer would ship that day and [...] would respond with another e-mail when it actually was shipped via FedEx.  So far this all sounds great but thinking it would probably be delivered in the 3-5 days standard shipping and wondering would it still be the same price or what?I went and had a Tuesday Dec. 27th morning surf session and when I got home around noon the printer was at my door step to my shock.  Set it up in an hour or so and put it thru all the scan, print and copy tests and it works great.  I haven't tried a photo yet but I have a feeling that will work out fine too.  So basically I got the printer for $33.49 with the $10 refund.  Yes it is a little noisy and takes a bit to warm up, but then it spits out copies in my opinion pretty fast.  The scan works really good and as good as the $200 scanner only we have at my work.  A photo has yet been tried but should take longer I am sure.  I only need the scan, print and copy modes for pdfs, word.docs, internet printouts and AutoCAD printouts. Also I think esthetically this printer is very nice looking and doesn't seem to flimsy like some.I know this is all a bit long winded but the moral of the story is I am always somewhat skeptical and cynical on how the system works but have to say both Amazon.com and [...] came thru with flying colors.  Especially [...'.  Since I had spent so much time researching and got a lemon Epson I was thinking this ain't going all that well with the time and hassle dealing with electronics which can be a black hole sometimes.Now I hope I haven't jinxed myself by writing this review and the damn thing craps out on me in the next week or so.  But at $33.49.....well Merry Christmas!  I feel like I was ""Born Under A Good Sign"" on this deal and bottom line I was just inquiring about availability and questioning my options.  Another note to all the people complaining about ink cartridge prices, all of these printers ink cost are high regardless of printer but some are a bit more reasonable.Regardless of the great price I got I really think I made the correct decision buying this particular Canon printer for my home needs.  Also I have noticed the price on this Canon model after the holidays has really gone back up close to its original retail of $99.99 at most outlets.

To my surprise, about 3/4 of the way through my second black toner cartridge, the three color cartridges were exhausted.  The supply counter reported that I had printed 4800 pages in color!  I print VERY LITTLE color, and I just could not understand it.  I called HP tech support, and was told that in fact even when you think you are printing black text only, the printer uses ""a little"" color toner too.  I was not happy to hear this, since nowhere in HP's literature that I could find is this mentioned, but OK. . .they told me I could prevent this by printing in ""draft"" instead of in ""normal,"" and by printing in greyscale.  So, I loaded the new color cartridges (THREE of them, at approx. $80 each!!!), and guess what?

So, I called tech support back and was THEN informed that there is no way to avoid ""using"" color (I don't know if the printer actually uses color, or if the counter just ""says"" it does.  The end result is the same.  You can't print in black if your color cartridges are ""out."")

Doing research and reading other reviews people stated there is no speed dial on the phone and this is not true.  You can program up to 50 numbers into the phone and retrieve them by simply pressing the memory button, selecting the number you saved and press talk.  The handset and base both have volume controls that allow for easy listening to messages or incoming calls.  Sound is much better than my old phone, I had trouble hearing people through the handset, the volume was very weak.Another feature that I found out about after I got the phone was that there is space in the base to charge an additional battery.  I was thrilled to learn this because the battery on my old phone would die all the time unless I always left it on the base.  All these new cordless phones with their lighted displays and fancy features all seem to have really bad battery life.  You do have to purchase the second battery which is slightly annoying.  But, it also powers the base for a couple of hours if the power goes out.  Nice feature.Navigation on the handset and the base were fairly intuitive to me, but I'm a gadget freak.  For the stuff I couldn't figure out the manual was pretty straightforward.  I like that the answering machine is in the base, I found having to use the handset with my old phone to be annoying at times.

Unfortunately, there are a few disappointing dealbreakers to this phone- see Con's.  I REALLY wanted to keep it, but this is not the one.  :(Pro's:-- Large, responsive buttons.  Easy to read white text on black buttons.  The base form factor is excellent.  Wall mountable base and accessory handset charger.-- Base station speaker is high quality- great sounding voicemail recording playback.  *Note, this does not include the mic (see Con's).-- Bluetooth pairing with my Samsung Galaxy S4 was extremely easy.  Quick visual indication of connected phones along with dedicated hard buttons to access each device.-- The GS4 consistently automatically connects via BT to the base as expected.  Good range, too.  Voice quality over Link2Mobile is clear.-- You can dial a phone number on the base and have the call go through your cell phone.  If you start a call on your cell phone you can easily transfer the call to the base by pressing the corresponding ""Cell"" button.  Link2Mobile call handoff was intuitive and worked great.-- Dedicated indicator lights to let you know someone else is using a specific line.  Phone automatically switches to the unused line when you attempt to use it.-- You can link up to 4 cell phones to this system.  Note, it's only easy to select between 4 cell phones while at the base station.-- The handsets use standard AAA size Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.Con's:-- This phone does NOT have a full-duplex speakerphone.  A full duplex speakerphone is the minimum requirement for sounding professional on business calls, therefore this phone is unacceptable.  Panasonic phones generally have this feature; however, this phone unfortunately does not.  I contacted Panasonic and they confirmed my issues with the speakerphone mic cutting out due to the half-duplex speakerphone.  (See theRCA 25216RE1for quality full-duplex calls on a 2-line phone with cellular Bluetooth capabilities.)-- The base station can only do speakerphone OR wired headset.  Since Panasonic does not manufacture a DECT headset, I'm forced to use a third-party Plantronics DECT headset that must be plugged into the 2.5mm headset jack on the base station. I quickly found out that if I want to switch from headset to speakerphone it will require unplugging the headset wire.  This is unacceptable.  It should be a simple button press to switch between headset and speakerphone like it is on every other phone.-- Phonebook download only works for contacts that are stored ""on-device"".  This means if you keep your contacts saved with a profile, e.g. your Google account, the ""Automatic phonebook download"" can't access them.  I also tried a ""Manual phonebook download"" by pushing my Google contacts list from my Galaxy S4 to this Panasonic and that didn't work either.  Huge failure.  The problem with saving your contacts on-device storage means they don't get backed up or synced and contacts can get ""lost"".  So, now I generally have no idea who's calling- who remembers phone numbers anymore?-- Missing a dedicated mute button.  The mute button winds up being a soft button under the main screen during a call.  The soft buttons are smaller and all-black, making hitting them less than quick and easy to depress if your office lights are off or you're fumbling around when your dog starts barking in the middle of a business call because UPS just delivered you some packages.-- No ""do not disturb"" (DND) button.  Very disturbing!  If I'm on an important call and another call comes in over my phone or other line, the base station doesn't shut up. It continues to ring and call out the number... LOUD, too. There is no intuitive way to silence it during a call or otherwise.-- The accessory handsets have no LED indicator for a voicemail alert.  You have no idea if there's a message waiting for you unless you specifically make a point to regularly check the base station.Other Thoughts:-- Current limited availability (Feb '14) of expandable handsets... and extreme costs for the ones that are available.  This is currently only sold in a base station version, or base station plus one accessory handset.  I need at least one to two more handsets and wish this came in a bundled set like other Panasonic models.-- Make the Redial and Erase buttons soft and the Mute and DND hard buttons instead.-- I like dedicated speed dial buttons with an optional card to write down info for the contact the button is assigned.",2,Not Suitable For Home Office,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",741,34,36,0.944444444,helpful

12425,A1CUG608KHS5D1,B00000JZKB,Richard C. Yeh,"[11, 14]","I just bought this calculator (December 2006) for use in actuary exams and I immediately experienced the problem where the calculator fails to record key presses.  I think this happens because the calculator will not register a second button press until the first button is completely released. If I enter calculations with two thumbs (as some people hold their BlackBerry devices) or multiple fingers, then this problem seems to happen a lot, and it's frustrating. If I use just a single finger to enter calculations, then the problem seems to go away.  (In contrast, my HP 32S II registers keys when they are pressed (even if one is being held down), and doesn't exhibit this problem.)The scientist in me appreciates the inclusion of trigonometric functions (which aren't available on the Hewlett-Packard line of business calculators).  This could be useful for business/finance/accounting students who only want one calculator but need to take a variety of different classes.Unfortunately, the calculator doesn't have an ""express exponent"" button for ease of entering numbers in scientific notation; the manual recommends that you use the y-to-the-xth-power button for this by typing, for example 6.022 x (10 y-to-the-xth-power 23); on most scientific calculators, you could type 6.022 E 23.  The calculator has natural logarithmic and exponential (base e) functions, but not common logarithmic and base-10 exponential functions.  (Of course, you can work around these easily, but I think they're much more useful to have as buttons than hyperbolic trig functions, which are also easily worked-around and are rarely seen in ordinary life.)Also, while the calculator does offer parentheses buttons, I find that these are super-hard to use without some visual feedback or indication of where you are in the calculation.  Casio calculators say how many parentheses you've opened, and two-line calculators (from any company) are great for showing the expression in progress, but here, it's easy to get the feeling that you're typing blindly, and, given the button problem I mentioned above, that's not a comfortable feeling.  For example, if you want to enter 6.022 x (10 y-to-the-xth-power 23 ) and instead enter 6.022 x 10 y-to-the-xth-power 23, you won't be able to tell that the calculator missed the parentheses button until you press the y-to-the-xth-power button and the calulator shows 60.22 in the display.  (You wouldn't need these parentheses in the available AOS (algebraic order-of-operations) mode, but it's not the default setting, and the no-visual-feedback problem still remains.)",3,Good but not great.

This newer KX-TG9334T set is far better with some unusual features I did not expect.First, under features it list ""Transferable phonebook = No"". And the DO NOT DISTURB looked to simply be a feature to turn off the ringing phone-set by phone-set. Not controlled from the base unit.However, actually the features they add are far superior.The DO NOT DISTURB (or NIGHT MODE) has the ability to enter a time span for NIGHT MODE to engage. So you can enter 11pm to 6am (for example) and turn on NIGHT MODE on one, two or all handsets.What happens is on the set time the ringer will not ring for that time span every day as long as NIGHT MODE is kept turned on.This is a great feature, MUCH better than a DO NOT DISTURB button on the base unit (some other brand phones), that silence all phones. The problem there is you MUST remember to dis-engage the do not disturb button to allow the phones to ring. A task often forgotten.With the Panasonic NIGHT MODE, the ""timer"" takes care of that for you.FANTASTIC!!!!Another great feature is the phonebook. No, you can not send a list between handsets, because you DONT NEED TO!The Panasonic KX-TG9334T keeps one phonebook list on the base units memory, that all attached handsets can access and add to or edit.That means, you can add a called to the book from  ANY handset, then ALL phones can see the same list. No more updating the list on one handset, then having to transfer that list to all other handsets on the system.The ""shared"" phonebook system is sooooo much nicer. Again... FANTASTIC!!!And the BLOCK CALLER feature is nice too. Do you have someone/place that tried to bug you selling stuff? Add their number to the BLOCKED LIST and when they try to call, the phone rings only once, then they get a busy signal. TAKE THAT UNWANTED CALLER!!!There are a few quirks I have to mention with the KX-TG9334T system.1. The lighted display is very bright. Too bright. And they should have added a brightness control.2. The message alert light should be more visible. It wraps from the back of the top to the top of the handset. If the handset is at eye level, like on a nightstand facing you, you can not see the flashing message waiting light hardly at all. You almost need to turn the handset backwards so you will see if a message comes in.My old panasonics had the same message light, but it wrapped around over the top to front of the handset, easily viewable.3.

However, the highlighted parts don't always fully erase (I was still fine with that) but more importantly, they run out of ink quickly. To test it out, I used the yellow highlighter while reading a normal novel size book (it was the history of a country) and though I only highlighted about 2 lines on each page, it ran out of ink by the 100th page and I had to switch to the orange. Additionally, the yellow highlighter isn't quite as bright as the normal fluorescent yellow highlighters, which was fine, but I noticed that the ink sits on top of the ink and page rather than being absorbed into it. Though it's minor, due to the ink siting atop the print, the ink slightly dilutes the intensity of black type. Overall I was satisfied but I think the formula needs to be tweaked so that the highlighter lasts more than 200 lines. I've had ""normal"" highlighters that seemingly never ran out of ink.

Setup was very smooth (except for HP's bloatware causing my browser to not work), the photographic output was good for a 4-ink system, scans were bright and crisp, and using this HP all-in-one was very easy to do using the brightly lit touch screen.  Highly recommended!*** UPDATE as of May 5, 2011.  My printer died.  I'm getting an ink system failure and/or print head error that can't be resolved by just reinserting the ink cartridges (HP branded) or removing the print head to clean it.  It's a hardware failure beyond a consumer's ability to fix.  I just downgraded my original 5-star rating to 4-stars because a printer that printed fewer than 5000 sheets of paper shouldn't fail this early.  I'll still buy another HP replacement all-in-one, though, because for as long as I've owned it, it's been a pretty sweet little machine. ****I just finished writing a review for a competing product, theEpson Artisan 710 Color Inkjet All-In-One Printer (C11CA53201).  After using that all-in-one for over a week, it didn't take long for me to realize how much more I prefer this HP all-in-one.  Although the feature set for both are very similar, the HP is much more intuitive to use.  Read on to learn more.*** INSTALLATION:Unpacking the HP was easy to do.  I was very pleased that it came with a package of 100 4x6 sheets of photo paper, so I could immediately begin printing some favorite family shots.  Shame on other vendors (think:  Epson) who include only a ""sample"" of a few sheets of photo paper!  This model uses a 4-ink system (1 black, 3 color) but the package includes an extra, high capacity black ink cartridge, too, for everyday printing.  Nice!I use my home network to connect to this HP.  The HP PhotoSmart C309 easily recognized my discoverable network, and it was very easy to use the touch screen to enter the 26-character key I have for my network.  Once entered, the printer was given an IP address by the router and it was ready to work after I installed the drivers on my computer.I really like how easy it was to insert paper into the front-loading tray.  Just raise up a lid, insert paper, put lid back down (for both general-use 8x11 paper and also for inserting 4x6 photo paper).  Later, I did experience a problem where the HP couldn't properly load the 4x6 paper into the printing mechanism.  Hopefully that's an anomaly.Installing the HP drivers was a breeze to do on my laptop.  It includes out-of-box support for Windows 7 on the enclosed CD-ROM disc (no searching HP's website for Windows 7 drivers!).  HOWEVER, by just quickly clicking through the installation windows, I inadvertently loaded seven other HP programs beyond the required drivers to support printing and scanning.  Among these were the HP Solutions Center, a program to help re-ordering HP supplies, a Customer Feedback program, HP Print Projects, and a customized Yahoo! toolbar for Internet Explorer.  I was thumping myself for not paying attention to the installation process that loaded all this crapware on my computer.  Very soon later, I really regretted it because after it was all loaded, my Internet Explorer wouldn't work (even after rebooting my computer).  I tried uninstalling the Yahoo! toolbar, and still IE8 wouldn't work.  Finally, I used Windows 7's restore feature to return to the last restore point before I loaded the HP drivers and programs, and that removed whatever was causing IE to not work.From that experience, I paid much closer attention to the 2nd attempt at installing the drivers.  HP doesn't make it obvious how to customize the install -- you must look closely for a link on the window that asks you to accept the EULA -- but you *can* deselect all the bloatware and install just 2 programs (the printer and scanner drivers), which is all you really need.  After those two programs were installed, the HP C309 was fully functional on my WiFi home network -- and IE was working, too!I got a new LG Env3 with Bluetooth, so I tried printing a photo taken with my phone using Bluetooth. Setting up Bluetooth was easy!  What I learned from the experience is that you must FIRST set the HP to look for Bluetooth devices, THEN place your phone in discovery mode.  Once my LG Env3 was paired with this HP, it was easy to print 4x6 photos.  And they looked terrific for a camera phone!*** USABILTY AND PERFORMANCE:Using the HP was a joy to do.  The photographs I printed were very, very good-looking, but depending on the photo, they were sometimes inferior to the six-color print output from the Epson Artisan 710.  The Epson's photos have very deep, rich colors and vibrancy, while the photos from this HP were sometimes not so rich in color depth, and not as vibrant.  I found that it depends on the photo whether the differences were apparent or not.  In some photos (lots of sunlit trees and grass), the differences were very slight.  When I printed a studio portrait of my in-laws, the result from this HP unit was as good as my other 6-color printer.  In other photos (for example, photos with a deep blue sky), the differences were more apparent (see the customer images I loaded showing this difference).  Camera flash-lit faces look a little yellowish coming from this printer.  Grass and trees have more yellow in them than what I'd expect, too.  If you're wondering whether a six-color printer can really print better than a 4-color printer, the answer is, **YES**, it can...but *not* always!  So if you want to print the absolute best photos possible -- all the time -- look to a different all-in-one than this HP PhotoSmart C309.  If you're not *that* excruciatingly picky, then this HP will do a very, very good job (especially if you're not contrasting photos printed from this HP with photos printed on another, 6-color machine).I used the ""Copy"" function to see how well the HP could duplicate a photograph.  Ideally, if you place a photo on the flatbed scanner and press Copy, the copied photo would be indistinguishable from the original, right?  Well, there was a definite difference between the copy and the original.  The copy was auto-cropped so it lost about a quarter-inch off the border of the original photograph.  The colors on the copy were less vivid, too, although the copy was more faithfully reproduced on this HP C309 than what the Epson Artisan 710 could achieve.Scans taken with this HP were very bright and vivid -- more so than what the Epson Artisan 710 could achieve.  The background white on my daughter's drawing was a very bright white, and her ink colors were rendered brightly and sharply on the scanned image.  (Keep in mind, I'm using all default, automatic settings -- I could achieve better results if I tried customizing the scan settings).  One thing:  some of the faint black lines on my daughter's drawing weren't picked up properly on the scanned image.  In all, I liked how the automatic scanned image looked.  Another perk:  The software creates a folder under My Pictures on your computer, and stores the scanned image inside that folder (rather than just adding it to My Pictures alone).I haven't used the HP long enough to speak to matters pertaining to ink usage.  Once I get more experience, I'll re-edit this review to include those details.SUMMARY:The HP PhotoSmart C309 is a terrific multifunction choice.  If you demand the very best in photographic output, look to a different model that uses a 6-ink system.  If good-looking photos is ""good enough"" for you, then be assured that this printer will print good looking photos.  The touchscreen interface was easy and intuitive to use, and loading paper into the front-side slot was no-hassle at all.  Aside from HP's bloatware during the software installation process (which you now know how to avoid after reading this review), I like everything about this HP model.  Highly recommended!*** NOVEMBER 16, 2009 UPDATEI just ordered 2 replacement color ink cartridges for this printer.  After printing 21 4x6 photos and maybe three dozen sheets of everyday 8x11 (mostly black text and a little color), the yellow and cyan ink cartridges dipped into the ""replace me"" levels.  The magenta and photo black inks are about one-half spent.Taking the advice of another reviewer, I opted to order 3 ""XL"" cartridges for quite a lot more than a regular 3-pack of the color cartridges.  I don't know whether the value equation will be favorable or not, but I'm hoping that the cost to print 4x6 photos will go a little lower than what it is currently (which by my calculations, each 4x6 photo costs about 50 to 75 cents to print).",4,Terrific choice if you don't demand photographic perfection (until it died),1257120000,"11 2, 2009",1483,121,124,0.975806452,helpful

Really hated to move away from the HP because it was built very well, before Carley F ran HP into the ground.The 9950F is only 8.5x11 format however does a very good job even at low res settings. At 1200x1200 DPI it takes about 1 minute per 35mm color slide.  The results are very very good. So, 12 slides will take 12 minutes. I have only done 35mm color slide so my experience with scans are from those and documents and printed color pictures.I give this 9950F a high rating also as the Canon software works very nicely with paper port 10 pro. Canon gives you an entry level paper port software along with the CanoScan Toolbox 4.9 software drivers.  I didn't like the entry level paper port so I used the pro version.  The Canon drivers have enough custom settings to please most avid scan users.  High 48 bit and hi-res setting will produce just over 100MB file size so, to get this setting to work you will need a powerful computer with plenty of memory and CPU. Today and with scans and digital photo's I'd say a minimum of 2GB of memory with at least a 3.0GHz cpu is fair game for friendly usage times.No complaints about the power switch from me as it is easy to use, up front and handy.  Canon place it just under the function buttons as to be handy but avoid accidental pressing it on or off.  The power saving software controls the light, you can set it to stay warm from 1 minute on up and the scanner powers off after the light turns off. Only the blue indicator led remains on to let you know the scanner is powered on but in sleep mode.I recommend this scanner for those who will prefer better digital scans with a great company behind it.",5,Great Flatbed Scanner,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",334,25,25,1,helpful

My experience has been very positive.I was looking for a 2-line phone, with speakerphones, an expandable system and a corded handset as my wife doesn't like the cordless.First, this is the only 5.8ghz phone I could find that had the features I needed.  My 2.4ghz phone gets garbled when the microwave runs and this phone does not do this.  The speakerphones work well and have become the primary way that I use the phone.  The cordless handset looks a little large but is actually very comfortable cradled on your shoulder.  The corded handset feels familiar and comfortable.I found the design a little odd at first, but have come to enjoy the futuristic orange back-lighting and general design.  It looks better turned on than it does on the box.  Functionally, the phone works very well and does exactly what it supposed to do, make and receive calls.  We use it for a standard landline plus a Vonage account.As with any product, there are a few things that could be improved (this is for the Motorola engineers).  The cordless should really be shipping with a NiMH battery, not a NiCAD.  The handset does fall off the base a little too easily, you need to use the wall setting hook and even then, it needs improvement.  Volume controls on the speakerphone are too coarse, there are only 4 levels where there should be 10.  The answering machine should pause after playing back each message and ask you what to do (i.e. delete, save, skip).  The keypad on the base is a little too small.  It would also be nice to have a few hard quick dial keys.There are also plenty of things done right.  Toll saver for the answering machine.  Separate answering functionality for both lines.  Message call forwarding.  Shared directories.  Room monitoring capabilities.  Good speakerphone.  Good overall sound quality.Anyway, I can't give it 5 stars, it doesn't quite make it.

After nearly breaking my back transporting them to a storage facility, I swore that I would never do it again: I would digitize everything.My main requirements of a scanner were (1) it must be able to feed more than one page at a time, (2) it must scan in duplex and, (3) it won't cost me a fortune. I did my research and the Fujitsu ScanSnap S510 pretty popped to the top of a very short list.All I can say is WOW! This little workhorse of a scanner has been everything I could hope for and more. I put the entire contents of those filing cabinets through it (probably 20,000+ sheets of paper) and have since then scanned and stored every piece paper that has come across my desk and several shelves of books whose pages I liberated from their bindings (probably another 10,000 sheets).

But this little guy just keeps on scanning day after day without complaint.The only slightly negative thing I can say about it is that even though it does a fairly good job of scanning photographs, it doesn't really match up against a flat-bed photo scanner for quality. If you quickly want to digitize a lot of photographs and quality isn't of paramount importance, then the S500 will do a fine job.

This Epson V300 is the latest home scanner for me.Speed: Back then a high resolution scanner was like 600dpi and required a SCSI connection in order to transfer that amount of information in reasonable amount of time. Thankfully, these days USB2 is ubiquitous and relatively high speed, so the bottleneck is really no longer at the connection nor the scanner. Instead, I found that I am usually CPU bounded because of all the image processing that happens *after* the data has been transfered to my computer. After all, 4800x9600dpi is a lot of information to go through. So yes, it can give you a slow scanning experience, but it's not the scanner's problem at all. I also note this scanner use an LED lighting source, the warmup time is about three seconds. This is much shorter than the older CFL scanners that can take a minute or two to warm up.Scanning quality: This is top-notch, especially given the price. I've seen results from much more expensive scanners including an high-end scanner from HP. At 1200dpi, which is a common setting for my workflow, I don't detect any material differences in the images, which is a good sign. If anything, the tiny difference is in the optical performance, most likely due to the coating on the glass that separates the document and the sensor. In particular, I do see a bit more chromatic aberration. However, this is something that can be corrected in software and I believe it is present in all scanners.Software: Having been an HP user for so long, I find the Epson Scan utility to be adequate and I actually like it better than HP's offering. It has all the features that I expect. Note that I did not install the other two included softwares---""Arcsoft MediaImpression"" and ""ABBYY Fine Reader Spring Plus OCR"". The former I have no interest, the second one is a lite version of ABBYY's commercial OCR product. I happen to have another OCR solution at my disposal and so I skipped this up-sell offering as well.

This time I did have some problems with this ink and I want to help out others by telling you the solution to get this ink to work in a Brother MFC-J825DW printer.  The replacement of the black ink was no problem at all for me.  The colors I replaced as they ran out and for a while they seemed to work.  However as the residual ink in the tubes of the machine were used up it became apparent that no ink was coming from the cartridge.  I removed the cartridge to see if the seal had not punctured but it appeared to be fine.  This led to my trying multiple cleanings and hours of frustration, and lots of googling!  As a last resort we took a paperclip and punctured the seal again.  When we did that we found that there must be two seals and the machine did not puncture deeply enough.  Push a paperclip in until you feel resistance and then push a little harder and it will puncture the second seal.  It still took a few deep cleanings to get the ink to come out because I had drained the tubes and it took a while for the ink to get to the heads.  In the process I used up additional cartridges because the deep cleaning process uses a lot of ink!!!  One other caution...make very very sure that you clean the paper clip between cartridges or your colors will mix...I had a yellow that was green for a long time because there was some blue on the paperclip when we punctured it.

It wasn't.  I really don't think it had anything to do with the wireless -- that portion went without a hitch.  After several hours, it is now installed as a wifi network device and labels can be created by Brother software and printed to it by the desktop tower and the netbook.  I'll work on the iPad next.Pro:The labels look very nice.  The label creation software is very full-featured.Getting *the printer* to register wirelessly on the network was quite easy.Label loading is very easyPrinting, advancing and cutting is so quiet that I thought it hadn't printed at first until I found the label on the floor!Labels look pretty affordable; address labels appear to run about 3 cents apieceYou can purchase postage through Pitney Bowes and print it to ""compatible label rolls.""Con:One bit of small print on one enclosed slick is the only notice you get that ""label printer must be connected to PC via USB for postage printing.""  That just deep-sixed the convenience of the wireless -- back to printing postage from the USPS siteI had a bear of a time with the installation on the CD/in the Quick Setup Guide, some details below.Here's how I ended up getting things installed, in case it is of help to anyone (I can't really see how it would be, as I mostly just muddled around until it worked, but I'll give it a shot):The provided instructions are next to useless.  I am sure someone worked very hard on them but I did follow them, or at least think I was doing so, and things didn't work.  The instructions in the book and on the included CD say that, even when installing the printer to be used via wifi, you should initially connect it with the provided USB cable.  When the installation was done, the printer was recognized on the network (wirelessly)and the wifi light on the printer was green, but the printer had been installed to the USB-attached computer as a USB device.  For that computer,  I had to uninstall the USB driver and re-install the driver, specifying that it was for a wifi printer, before it would work.  I don't know whether it would be better to try the initial install without using the USB cable, or if you need to do that to get the wifi key into the printer. &lt;shrug>In the meantime, I went hither and yon on the Brother support site.  By Googling ""Brother QL-710W Troubleshooting,"" I found the driver download I needed for the CD-less netbook, and also the label creation software for that machine.  Given that this is intended to be a networked printer, you'd think the manual would have a big header saying ""here's what you do for your network devices that don't have CD drives"" and a set of download links for your netbook, your iPad, etc.  Instead, you have to deduce which app to use, and *then* go get the serial number for your printer in order to install it.  Seriously, am I going to be stealing your software to use if I don't have your printer?  If it's a network printer, why would you be restricting the drivers and label creation software to use with it?  I don't get that.Also, if you're going to ship the product with a 40-page printed manual, at least put a troubleshooting section in it, although I have to say the troubleshooting FAQs on the website were of no help, either.",2,Why advertise that you can print postage from this wireless printer when it has to be hooked up via USB to do so?,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",594,10,15,0.666666667,helpful

I did not know what to expect since the price of the whole thing is less than what I am used to paying for just a toner cartridge.  My first impressions are quite positive.I connected the printer via an Ethernet (cat-5) cable to my router, thus making it into a network printer.  My machines are running Linux Ubuntu 12.04.  The CUPS setup did not find a good driver for this model.  So I went to Samsung's site and downloaded their UnifiedLinuxDriver_0.92.tar.gz which I unpacked, then executed its install.sh script.  This brings up a GUI installation dialog box and takes you through the steps of the installation process.  This needs to be done as root because it puts the requisite software in /opt. Additionally, it renames the old /usr/bin/lpr to /usr/bin/lpr.orig, then makes a symlink from /usr/bin/lpr to the new /opt/Samsung/mfp/bin/slpr.To print from the commandline, just do ""lpr filename"".  Unlike the traditional lpr which works silently, this one pops up a dialog box where you can adjust various printing parameters before clicking ""OK"".  Being a Unix traditionalist, I don't care for dialog boxes.  So I removed /usr/bin/lpr (which is a symlink, anyway) and restored /usr/bin/lpr.orig to /usr/bin/lpr.  Now, ""lpr filename"" prints without a dialog box, as God had intended it to.Some of the printer's blurbs say that it offers 600dpi and 1200dpi resolutions.  The 1200dpi is not a true 1200dpi though -- it is an ""effective 1200dpi"" which is not quite the same.  I am happy with the 600dpi mode so I will keep it that way.It prints pleasantly fast and the print quality is excellent.  The printer goes to sleep after a minute of inactivity, in which case it saves electricity and is completely silent.  The manual says that it draws less than 1.2 watts in the sleep mode.  Since I print very infrequently, I would have rather turned it off completely, but this printer has no On/Off switch.  Well, what do you expect at this dirt-cheap price?Please note that the printer comes with a power cable but no data cables.  You will need either an Ethernet cable or a USB cable to hook it up.Further notes:1. Looking through the files installed under /opt, I found ""/opt/Samsung/mfp/share/ppd/ML-2950spl2.ppd"" (2950s means the 2950 series).  Probably that file is all we need to install the driver directly through CUPS but I haven't tried.2. The printer has a web interface.

613600,A3NGOG8Z78AZSD,B002O3W4LO,Edward Barnett,"[14, 14]","I've been using Ooma's VOIP service for half a year.  I have one Ooma Telo device at work and another in my home office.  Ooma's VOIP service is simply outstanding.  The call quality is better than my landline service with Verizon, the feature set (most of which is configured/managed online) makes old-fashioned phone service look old fashioned, and the physical Ooma Telo unit is beautifully designed and very easy to use.  In other words, I'm a huge Ooma fan.  It's the best VOIP solution -- and in fact the best phone solution -- I've found.Having said that, I have been disappointed in the Ooma handset.  Importantly, the handset is not required to use the Ooma Telo and VOIP service.  The only reason to buy the Ooma handset is if you subscribe to the Ooma Premier service for an additional monthly fee.  One of the features of Ooma Premier is that you can have two phone numbers with one Telo unit, and you can dial out on the second line if someone else is using the first line (or use the second line to take a second call without having to hang up on the first line or put them on hold, or use the second line to initiate a conference call).  Dialing out on the second line requires the Ooma handset, and this is the only reason to buy the Ooma handset.  Other than this special functionality, the handset is inferior to the regular old vtech and Uniden phones I also use with my Ooma Telo.  The Ooma handset is not as comfortable in the palm, the screen is smaller and darker than on most modern handsets, it has no headset jack, seating the handset in the charging base is more awkward than with most phones, and the handset has quality issues (the battery in my first handset, which Ooma replaced, would not hold a charge).  I do not find the sound quality between the Ooma handset and Telo to be better than with third party handsets.If you want to access the second line feature when someone else is using Line 1, you'll need this handset.  The Ooma lines are virtual lines, not physically separate wires, so a 2-line phone system can't see the second Ooma line.  The Ooma Telo can receive calls on both lines using any old handsets, and you can also call out on either line using any handset, so the only reason to buy this Ooma handset is if you want to be able to use the ""instant second line"" feature that let's you call out on Line 2 when someone else is already using Line 1.  If you don't need that feature, I would not recommend this handset, which suffers in terms of design, features, and quality relative to cheaper handsets from major manufacturers.Ooma Telo:  Awesome device and service!Ooma Handset:  Not so much.UPDATE 18 Sept 2011:  As noted above, the battery on my first phone wouldn't hold a charge, so Ooma sent me a new one.  It appeared that the replacement phone was a refurb, which was discouraging given that the new Ooma handset that wouldn't hold a charge was brand new (literally, two days old when I boxed it up and sent it back).  After just a week of use, the new phone has developed problems.  The screen periodically goes ""scrambled"", with a mosaic of crazy ASCII characters.  When this happens, the menus are inaccessible, rendering the phone as dumb as rotary phone from 1964 and preventing use of the second line (which is the only reason to have the special Ooma handset).  The only solution is to pull the battery out and reboot, which I have to do daily.  I'm dropping my review to 2 stars because of the serious quality issues.  As I said before, the Ooma Telo device and service are awesome -- I'm a huge fan and use multiple devices for home and work -- but the handset is poorly designed and has the kind of show-stopper quality issues that you just don't expect to see in electronics in this day and age.",2,Only purchase if you need to access Ooma's instant 2nd line feature,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",683,14,14,1,helpful

399400,A1RZCPYJA8W8EZ,B001770MJ4,Calvo,"[30, 31]","I purchased the ESP-5 based on a coworker's experience with Kodak All-in-One printers.  The biggest selling point was the cost of the replacement ink.  Having spent a small fortune on HP ink over the years on two HP printers, I was ready for a change.  The set-up of the Kodak was pain free and the initial printing of pictures went off without a hitch.  I used HP 4X6 photo paper that I had left over and was impressed with the color and quality of the prints.  Then things got ugly.  Addressing an envelope caused a paper jam.  After clearing the jam, the printer no longer printed properly.  After running through the trouble shooting diagnostics, I got an error message stating that the problem required calling the Help line.  First call was a waste of time.  The 'techie' wasn't listening, but reading from a script that was not in his native tongue.  Second call went slightly better, 'techie' said it sounded like a problem with the print head.  She said she would send a new print head and ink cartridges overnight.  I did receive them the next day.  This didn't cure the problem.  Third call to Kodak lasted about half an hour.  After telling the 'techie' to not talk, but listen closely I explained exactly what wasn't happening.  His solution was to send me to the Kodak website and download new firmware.  Lo and behold, my printer is now behaving like a well mannered child, doing everything it's told to do.  Prints are of excellent quality, copies are good, scans are good, too.  In summary, if you want to save money on ink replacements and have patience, then the Kodak printer is a good buy.",3,Patience is a virtue,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",284,30,31,0.967741935,helpful
946073,AR8BZOQFCV29I,B005KOWTX2,Cassandra,"[7, 13]","This phone is unacceptable, because voicemail and call forwarding don't operate until the phone has been ringing about 60 seconds. I strongly believe this is a GE firmware problem. The phone lets you configure a number of Skype settings, but not the ring-time delay. When they short-cut that functionality, I bet they made a decision as to a reasonable fixed interval and mistakenly picked one minute as a suitable delay. Virtually no one will wait that long for their call to be picked-up, so people understandably hang-up before these features are triggered. Thus, in effect, the phone doesn't support voicemail or call forwarding - two of Skype's very nice features.GE has been blowing off customer complaints about this and blaming the problem on Skype, but no one's buying this. A number of Skype customers have complained to their  support people, and as of 10/7/11 Skype management has joined their customers in telling GE to get on this problem.The phone supports downloading firmware upgrades, so in theory the problem can be fixed. The question is: how long will it take GE to fix, test, and publish the patch? I'm guessing this could take quite a while, so I'm returning the phone.",1,Unacceptable Voicemail/Call Forwarding Delay,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",200,7,13,0.538461538,helpful
747576,A658UZTHK6GQ3,B003X27H9O,kolyur,"[49, 49]","My primary use for a label printer is to mark wires in industrial electrical cabinets. I need the type of label where the text is printed repeatedly perpendicular to the label direction, then wrapped around the wire. (NOT the ""flag"" type where the label is just folded in half over the wire.) This type of application requires the nylon cloth tape, which is available for most brands of label makers.I had previously used a Brady IDpal, which had some advantages but was not very reliable. After comparing and reading reviews for the Rhino 5200 and Brother P-touch units, I decided to purchase the Rhino 5200. In short, I was disappointed in the wire wrap capability of the Rhino and ended up returning it. The literature claimed that it would print labels for wires as small as 22awg (which I often use), but I came to find out that the shortest wire wrap label it will print is 1-1/4"" long. Why on earth would you need 1-1/4"" of label to wrap around a wire only 1/16"" in diameter? For the short time I had it, I ended up trimming and wasting more label tape than I actually used.Enter the Brady BMP21. The shortest wire wrap label it will print is 3/4"", which still can be longer than necessary for tiny wires, but it's way better than the waste from the Rhino. Plus, the label cartridges are cheaper than Rhino and you can get 3/8"" tape (Rhino only goes down to 1/2""). I haven't used many functions yet other than the wire wrap labels, but it seems like a rugged unit and I'm sure it will serve my purpose. The backlight is a nice touch. If you need wire wrap labels, the BMP21 would be my recommendation.UPDATE 7/28/2011:After using this labeler for almost a year, it has served my purpose well. The label cartridges are fairly inexpensive and even cheaper on eBay. My only complaint is that it seems to drain batteries fairly quickly, even when not in use. I've gotten into the habit of removing one of the batteries before putting it away, to minimize this problem. I'd suggest investing in the AC adapter if you purchase this unit.",4,Best option for wire wrap labels,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",368,49,49,1,helpful

901173,AJJLCVDWYE8TB,B0051GK6RA,"M. Rosander ""hobbyist""","[60, 62]","I have owned before 2 different laptop coolers.  The Targus Lap Chill Mat AWE55US, and the Logitech Cooling Pad N100.  Neither of those lasted even 6 months before they died.  The Targus was big sized, so maybe a lil more ideal for my Dell XPS 1640, and it did live longer than my logitech, but the logitech seemed to cool better than the targus...at least for the first 2 weeks.  After that, the logitech started slowing down, not cooling as much, and then quit altogether.  So I decided to try something different and just bought the Cooler Master Notepal LapAir after reading all the statistics on air flow for it.I've had it 3 days so far and have run it non-stop aside from when I go to bed I unplug it.  The fan is pretty quiet (more quiet than the fan inside my Dell), and it really does move the air!!!  I use my laptop on my lap, so was hoping the rear intake vent would help with the issues most all other coolers have of intake from the bottom, and it does.  The rear intake is also nice because that means I can set the laptop on my couch for a minute and not worry so much about it sucking in more dust.  It is fairly comfortable on my legs too, though it does feel a tad heavy. I was concerned about the type of fan it has in it because I've never worked with a 'blower fan', I've always used the standard style ones with the kind of curvy blades and I saw other coolers that had my eye simply because of the standard style fan in them and the large size of the fan.  But let me tell you, I do NOT regret buying this kind, it really moves air!!!  And amazingly, it feels colder than the air in my room.  In fact it makes my legs cold so now I'm using a throw blanket on my lap because I lost my lap warmer!This is a good thing though because my computer is performing much better, much cooler to the touch, and able to handle my games.  I've been playing LOTRO and Second Life, both fairly video intensive and my laptop used to have trouble even on lower settings.  The FPS are not suffering at all so far.  So in summary, this is one powerful laptop cooler definitely worth the buy!  I can play games I couldn't play for months because it is really powerful at cooling!  I no longer worry about burning the skin off my hands, my laptop barely feels warm at all to the touch. I haven't tested internal temperatures (lots of other review sites have), but I know by it's performance my computer is running much cooler.The only negatives I have really aren't negatives, but could be improved:  1. It's a little heavy on the lap, not bad, but lighter would be better.  2. I would love if it had an on/off switch instead of having to unplug it, but as a tradeoff I guess unplugging it reduces the risk of damaging the cord/usb socket by accidental bumps.  3.  The USB cord sticks out way too far.  I like that it has USB pass through, but am pretty sure they could engineer that to make it smaller, but function over form all in all it's ok.  Highly recommended and would buy again because the performance on this is fantastic, the real test now is to see it's longevity!  Hoping it can last at least a year unlike my Targus and Logitech.  We'll see :)",5,It really keeps it cool!,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",601,60,62,0.967741935,helpful
