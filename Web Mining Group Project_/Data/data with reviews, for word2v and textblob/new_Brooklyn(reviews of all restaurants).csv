My boyfriend hates onions and he helped me finish it.', ""I found this restaurant on Groupon for a great price. The service was great. I feel the decor should be updated. I have no complaints on the food and that's what matters."", ""I am utterly distraught by how this dinner turned out.\nThe evening started off in a mist of rain, dark and sexy. We arrived promptly at 7:17pm for our 7:30 reservations. Once inside we were told to wait in a dark dank corner beside the bar. After waiting for 30min we finally decided to speak to someone about the delay. Unbeknownst to us, the person who was going to be our server[ Angel] gave us complimentary drinks at the bar for our long wait.\n\nWe were finally seated at 830pm, and then ordered our appetizers( which were 2 orders of baked clams). It took 40 min for our dishes to arrived and when they did the clams were gummy, luke warm, and lacked any sort if wow factor.  For our entrees we ordered the Black Angus Rib eye and the Skirt Steak. Their sides were blah; their specialty the potato pie was amazing to say the least. The cream spinach was absolutely disgusting!! It was bland, no creaminess at all. Just white washed greens. Soooo not what I wanted. I wanted cheesy creaming spinach.  It look like a sad attempt on social media hash tag #nailedit  #cookingforbae . Honestly that just made me even more upset. Upside, the steaks were cooked perfectly at Medium Rare.\n\nAngel was an amazing waiter! He was attentive, quick and helped as much as he could. While he ran around the establishment like a chicken with it's head cut off he was very much a great conversationalist. He was the absolute best, and I would love for him to be my server if I was a patron to a different establishment. At the end of the dinner he even served us a complementary Chocolate Pie that I literally licked the plate. So flippin good lol.\n\nHeres the Snapple fact the bill was $216.00. I don't have an issue if it was worth it. But for shitty service, watered down drinks, and subpar food the most I say it was worth $100. It was a glammed up Outback( I shouldn't speak bad of Outback at least they're nice and have the blooming onion lol) If we didn't have Angel I surely would've disputed everything. I wanted to speak to a manger but I was convinced otherwise not to. To top it off  Valet, wasn't even included...so many strikes.   I wouldn't dare dock their doors EVER!! AGAIN!!!  They are on my Yelp Diners Beware List."", ""We love Embers. We've been coming here for the last 15yrs. The potato pie is our favorite side dish.

That\'s how cooked seafood smells! The issue of the kitchen not having a proper exhaust system in place is a different story.\n\nAppetizers\nBaked clams\nThey were wonderful and I could have eaten 2 orders easily by myself! The issue I had with these clams is that all of them were of different sizes! From the smallest to the largest, all of them were of different sizes. Not very efficient when you have to share it with other people.\n\nTomato mozzarella salad\nFresh cheese and tomatoes and sauce were great! 2 pieces of each!\n\nCoconut shrimp\nShrimp pieces were surprisingly large and the sauce was amazing!\n\nSalmon\nFresh and cooked nicely! When they brought it out it looked dry, but when I parted it, it was just perfect! The mushed potato is mixed with cheese and bacon, so it was a little too salty because of these additions.\n\nCod\nSuch a great meal! Quite large! Comes in a baking pot with a bunch of  cooked tomatoes, peppers, onion and green olives. I would come back just to get another order of this cod!\n\nDessert\nWe ordered cheesecake, chocolate cake with hazelnuts and tiramisu. ALL of them to die for!

Bacon appetizer was tasty but cannot say the same for the fried calamari. Onion rings seem to be the chopped onion frozen type... major disappointment. Always good service. Used a Groupon on several occasions which they gladly accepted.', ""The place is located in a nice calm area of BK, Once you enter the ambience is very calm you could dress down or up, there's no specific dressing attire required which I love . Both times I've been here services was on point! My server was was polite & attentive,  food came in a timely fashion. Embers steak is so delicious,  especially their homemade steak sauce cause a homie dislikes that not so great A1 steak sauce. I just recently got in to eating my steak medium which keeps the steak so juice and the chef had it on point, it was Moo'ing or winking at me, it was just right no blood dripping out of it nor a hockey puck .

My boyfriend hates onions and he helped me finish it.', ""I found this restaurant on Groupon for a great price. The service was great. I feel the decor should be updated. I have no complaints on the food and that's what matters."", ""I am utterly distraught by how this dinner turned out.\nThe evening started off in a mist of rain, dark and sexy. We arrived promptly at 7:17pm for our 7:30 reservations. Once inside we were told to wait in a dark dank corner beside the bar. After waiting for 30min we finally decided to speak to someone about the delay. Unbeknownst to us, the person who was going to be our server[ Angel] gave us complimentary drinks at the bar for our long wait.\n\nWe were finally seated at 830pm, and then ordered our appetizers( which were 2 orders of baked clams). It took 40 min for our dishes to arrived and when they did the clams were gummy, luke warm, and lacked any sort if wow factor.  For our entrees we ordered the Black Angus Rib eye and the Skirt Steak. Their sides were blah; their specialty the potato pie was amazing to say the least. The cream spinach was absolutely disgusting!! It was bland, no creaminess at all. Just white washed greens. Soooo not what I wanted. I wanted cheesy creaming spinach.  It look like a sad attempt on social media hash tag #nailedit  #cookingforbae . Honestly that just made me even more upset. Upside, the steaks were cooked perfectly at Medium Rare.\n\nAngel was an amazing waiter! He was attentive, quick and helped as much as he could. While he ran around the establishment like a chicken with it's head cut off he was very much a great conversationalist. He was the absolute best, and I would love for him to be my server if I was a patron to a different establishment. At the end of the dinner he even served us a complementary Chocolate Pie that I literally licked the plate. So flippin good lol.\n\nHeres the Snapple fact the bill was $216.00. I don't have an issue if it was worth it. But for shitty service, watered down drinks, and subpar food the most I say it was worth $100. It was a glammed up Outback( I shouldn't speak bad of Outback at least they're nice and have the blooming onion lol) If we didn't have Angel I surely would've disputed everything. I wanted to speak to a manger but I was convinced otherwise not to. To top it off  Valet, wasn't even included...so many strikes.   I wouldn't dare dock their doors EVER!! AGAIN!!!

I don't know if it's because I went on a moderately-paced Tuesday afternoon, as opposed to a busy weekend brunch, but nearly every aspect of this place was phenomenal. Without exaggeration, I just had one of the best breakfasts in recent memory.\n\nI ordered the Deluxe breakfast, which comes with juice (I chose their freshly-squeezed OJ), tea or coffee, 2 eggs (I got them poached), 2 slices of in-house baked multigrain toast, home fries (I get them well done), two flapjacks (i.e. pancakes for you Brits/Aussies reading this), and a side of your choosing. I don't always see corned beef hash as an available side at many breakfast joints, so I opted for that instead of the typical pork bacon or pork sausage (for non-pork eaters, they also have turkey bacon, and for vegans, they have also veggie sausage). All this for only $15!\n\nIf I were to nitpick, the only two things that made the food overall less-than-perfect was the toast came out a tad too well done, and I could've done without powdered sugar being dusted on top of the flapjacks.\n\nThe eggs were perfectly poached (i .e. runny yolk) on top of the toast and the home fries were cooked nicely well done. The corned beef hash was better than any I've ever had before. What made the hash so unique was the use of ancho chili powder seasoning that gave it a little touch of spiciness. Finally, the flapjacks were nice and fluffy. Oh, and they were served with a big bottle of REAL MAPLE syrup!\n\nDom (Dominique) was my server and she couldn't have been more of a pleasure with her affable hospitality! I'm a high maintenance kind of customer when it comes to my breakfasts, especially when they include both the savory (eggs, home fries, and hash) and the sweet (flapjacks). Dom didn't bat an eye with every specific request I had and touched the table multiple times to ensure everything was going well.\n\nThey don't cheap out or take any shortcuts many diners do on anything. So many diners use cheap OJ, instead of freshly-squeezed, generic preservative-laden bread, instead of homemade, and fake maple syrup, instead of the real stuff.  It's an old school, greasy-spoon diner that goes the extra mile to appeal to the discriminating palate of many Brooklynites. Honestly, for the value alone, I would recommend those who live in the other boroughs take the trip to this special diner.\n\nHow does this place stay in business for over 20 years charging such cheap prices in an affluent Brooklyn neighborhood?\n\nI just wish, instead of living close to the 2 subway (a 15-minute walk), I lived close to the F/G subway, because they are literally right outside the 7th Ave station. Although with all the calories I consumed, it's probably better to be able to walk it off."", 'Loved our servers, but the food was just okay for the price. Also, what\'s up with the ""Cash Only, but only at brunch"" deal here?\n\nWe walked in at around 11:30 for brunch and were advised that the wait would be about 10 to 15 minutes. Totally understandable since it was a Sunday, a prime brunch day, and the restaurant has a small indoor seating area. They\'re also in the middle of renovations which I\'m sure doesn\'t help.\n\nWe were seated by our lovely host much sooner than we anticipated, and brought out mini scones and muffins to snack on while we looked at our menus. We ordered drinks and coffee, both of which were pretty good and brought out quickly by our server.\n\nFor my dish, I went with the Dizzy\'s Burger (but swapped out the traditional beef for the Beyond patty) which comes with lettuce, tomato, American cheese, sweet pickles, a tomato-basil aioli, and fried shallots, on a toasted roll with hand-cut fries. It was a decent burger, but definitely not worth $22. It was missing the pickles and the patty AND the fries were totally lacking salt which made the entire plate pretty tasteless. We also ordered the Biscuits & Gravy which looked good, although I didn\'t get to try.\n\nThis came out to be a pretty expensive brunch considering this place is still a diner and the food was just okay. Not sure I\'d care to visit again.', ""This was my first visit to Dizzy's. It was a Saturday at 9am after a race at Prospect Park. I took a seat in the empty restaurant. I ordered the Deluxe which consisted of 2 scrambled eggs, 2 pancakes, home fries house toast and pork sausage patty. I enjoyed my meal while listening to some soft jazzy tunes. The eggs and the pancakes are small but my plate was still covered  with the other items. The taste was fine. I don't know how business normally is because the small place got packed with runners some time after. Staff was great."", ""I'm sorry to say that this place is just not what it use to be. I think its under new management now because I didn't recognize anyone who works here anymore. The service was awful, we waited about 30 minutes (no exaggeration) to order and this is because all the servers were huddled by the register having a conversation. Our waited messed up everything we ordered and kept forgetting anything we asked for. Our coffee was brought to us way after the food. My friend asked for milk and it took her 15 minutes to get it, no point now since the coffee is cold. Just so sad that this place took such a hit. I miss what this place use to be. RIP dizzys."", ""This is my go to brunch spot. If you go here during the weekends before 4pm you get a large variety of brunch items. The scones and muffins with strawberry butter is something I look forward to very much when I go there. The pistachio and banana stuffed French toast is amazing but my absolute favorite is the biscuits and gravy! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."", ""I love Dizzy's and I love you. Endless love. Deep love. Take another piece of my love now baby. L is for the way you look at me, O is for the only one I see, two can make a heart and break it and E is extraordinary in LOVE.

I want to update my review and reiterate the five stars. This local neighborhood ""finer diner"" is a diamond in the rough of these few blocks around here. Still wish they opened earlier than 9 on weekends. They do a terrific brunch business. But they also have a wonderful dinner with beer & wine selections, good music, finer/diner vibe. It\'s comfort food with some inventive approaches. After 7pm, crowd is less busy with families and young kids. It\'s great fun when the owner/head chef is in the house. Also, on top of F/G 7th St Station it\'s convenient to many and a good place for a breakfast meeting as you get started with workday.', 'Great comfort food.  Ingredients are very fresh.

I use to go to their 5th ave location, which I loved but since that location closed, this is the first time I've been to this location.\n\nThere was a bit of a wait at 11am on Saturday which was to be expected. The service was pretty bad. We had 3 adults and 2 kids but they only put down 2 cups for water and 2 utensil sets. Had to ask a few times before we even got extra cups and forks.\n\nThe food was definitely not as good as the other location. I got the chicken and waffle, my friends got the huevos rancheros, an omelette, and the kids shared the strawberry and banana flap jacks. My chicken and waffle was ok, the chicken was dried and over fried. The waffles had cheddar and bacon in the batter which sounded interesting but just didn't quite hit the mark. It was a bit soft and soggy overall, not the crispy waffle I was hoping for. The flap jacks were soft and slightly burnt. I think it's because the strawberries and bananas are inside the pancake which makes it not crisp up and fluff up. I tried a few bites and I didn't think it was good.\n\nMy friends said the omelette and huevos rancheros were ok though.\nOverall, not for me.""]",364,"[""How is this place not ranked at least 4 1/2 stars?! I don't know if it's because I went on a moderately-paced Tuesday afternoon, as opposed to a busy weekend brunch, but nearly every aspect of this place was phenomenal. Without exaggeration, I just had one of the best breakfasts in recent memory.\n\nI ordered the Deluxe breakfast, which comes with juice (I chose their freshly-squeezed OJ), tea or coffee, 2 eggs (I got them poached), 2 slices of in-house baked multigrain toast, home fries (I get them well done), two flapjacks (i.e. pancakes for you Brits/Aussies reading this), and a side of your choosing. I don't always see corned beef hash as an available side at many breakfast joints, so I opted for that instead of the typical pork bacon or pork sausage (for non-pork eaters, they also have turkey bacon, and for vegans, they have also veggie sausage). All this for only $15!\n\nIf I were to nitpick, the only two things that made the food overall less-than-perfect was the toast came out a tad too well done, and I could've done without powdered sugar being dusted on top of the flapjacks.\n\nThe eggs were perfectly poached (i .e. runny yolk) on top of the toast and the home fries were cooked nicely well done. The corned beef hash was better than any I've ever had before. What made the hash so unique was the use of ancho chili powder seasoning that gave it a little touch of spiciness. Finally, the flapjacks were nice and fluffy. Oh, and they were served with a big bottle of REAL MAPLE syrup!\n\nDom (Dominique) was my server and she couldn't have been more of a pleasure with her affable hospitality! I'm a high maintenance kind of customer when it comes to my breakfasts, especially when they include both the savory (eggs, home fries, and hash) and the sweet (flapjacks). Dom didn't bat an eye with every specific request I had and touched the table multiple times to ensure everything was going well.\n\nThey don't cheap out or take any shortcuts many diners do on anything. So many diners use cheap OJ, instead of freshly-squeezed, generic preservative-laden bread, instead of homemade, and fake maple syrup, instead of the real stuff.  It's an old school, greasy-spoon diner that goes the extra mile to appeal to the discriminating palate of many Brooklynites. Honestly, for the value alone, I would recommend those who live in the other boroughs take the trip to this special diner.\n\nHow does this place stay in business for over 20 years charging such cheap prices in an affluent Brooklyn neighborhood?\n\nI just wish, instead of living close to the 2 subway (a 15-minute walk), I lived close to the F/G subway, because they are literally right outside the 7th Ave station. Although with all the calories I consumed, it's probably better to be able to walk it off."", 'Loved our servers, but the food was just okay for the price. Also, what\'s up with the ""Cash Only, but only at brunch"" deal here?\n\nWe walked in at around 11:30 for brunch and were advised that the wait would be about 10 to 15 minutes. Totally understandable since it was a Sunday, a prime brunch day, and the restaurant has a small indoor seating area. They\'re also in the middle of renovations which I\'m sure doesn\'t help.\n\nWe were seated by our lovely host much sooner than we anticipated, and brought out mini scones and muffins to snack on while we looked at our menus. We ordered drinks and coffee, both of which were pretty good and brought out quickly by our server.\n\nFor my dish, I went with the Dizzy\'s Burger (but swapped out the traditional beef for the Beyond patty) which comes with lettuce, tomato, American cheese, sweet pickles, a tomato-basil aioli, and fried shallots, on a toasted roll with hand-cut fries. It was a decent burger, but definitely not worth $22. It was missing the pickles and the patty AND the fries were totally lacking salt which made the entire plate pretty tasteless. We also ordered the Biscuits & Gravy which looked good, although I didn\'t get to try.\n\nThis came out to be a pretty expensive brunch considering this place is still a diner and the food was just okay. Not sure I\'d care to visit again.', ""This was my first visit to Dizzy's. It was a Saturday at 9am after a race at Prospect Park. I took a seat in the empty restaurant. I ordered the Deluxe which consisted of 2 scrambled eggs, 2 pancakes, home fries house toast and pork sausage patty. I enjoyed my meal while listening to some soft jazzy tunes. The eggs and the pancakes are small but my plate was still covered  with the other items. The taste was fine. I don't know how business normally is because the small place got packed with runners some time after. Staff was great."", ""I'm sorry to say that this place is just not what it use to be. I think its under new management now because I didn't recognize anyone who works here anymore. The service was awful, we waited about 30 minutes (no exaggeration) to order and this is because all the servers were huddled by the register having a conversation. Our waited messed up everything we ordered and kept forgetting anything we asked for. Our coffee was brought to us way after the food. My friend asked for milk and it took her 15 minutes to get it, no point now since the coffee is cold. Just so sad that this place took such a hit. I miss what this place use to be. RIP dizzys."", ""This is my go to brunch spot. If you go here during the weekends before 4pm you get a large variety of brunch items. The scones and muffins with strawberry butter is something I look forward to very much when I go there. The pistachio and banana stuffed French toast is amazing but my absolute favorite is the biscuits and gravy! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."", ""I love Dizzy's and I love you. Endless love. Deep love. Take another piece of my love now baby. L is for the way you look at me, O is for the only one I see, two can make a heart and break it and E is extraordinary in LOVE. Get the biscuits and gravy w/ an RcCola and go\nLove yourself"", ""We have lived in the neighborhood for 17 years and frequented this place that long. Heck, our kids grew up here. Matteo, the owner is a great guy with deep knowledge of the culinary arts. He may have invented the finer diner concept and this is a perfect spot for that. Through the years there have been some ups and downs. Staff turnover has been high at some points as M adjusts to the changing neighborhood. But this place has recently been renovated and I understand M will be a chef in the kitchen on some nights including Fridays. The food and ingredients have always been very good-excellent. The people who work here have always been good-excellent. We are excited about the new menu and the renovated space. Congrats to Dizzy's!"", 'I wrote a review on Dizzy\'s a few years ago. I want to update my review and reiterate the five stars. This local neighborhood ""finer diner"" is a diamond in the rough of these few blocks around here. Still wish they opened earlier than 9 on weekends. They do a terrific brunch business. But they also have a wonderful dinner with beer & wine selections, good music, finer/diner vibe. It\'s comfort food with some inventive approaches. After 7pm, crowd is less busy with families and young kids. It\'s great fun when the owner/head chef is in the house. Also, on top of F/G 7th St Station it\'s convenient to many and a good place for a breakfast meeting as you get started with workday.', 'Great comfort food.  Ingredients are very fresh.

The main reason was the young lady who took care of us.  She had an amazing energy and attitude that made us feel welcome and important from the second we came in until the time we left.  It was a fairly crowded evening (a Saturday) and we were a big group but she kept the drinks flowing.    \n\nFood was really good.  We liked our fried pickles to snack on and the horseradish burger was perfection.   I will say it was very juicy and therefore a mess to eat but I didn't mind washing my hands afterwards (of course now I wash my hands 100 times per day)\n\nThe music was excellent, too.  Helped contribute to the great atmosphere of this place.  We asked the bearish bartender and he said it was his Spotify playlist, so kudos to that as well.\n\nI remember coming to this location back when it was Sheep Station and I liked it then but I really like it better as Douglass Public House and I hope to have the chance to come back here."", ""Held a birthday dinner for my boyfriend here and the staff did a great job in hosting as well as providing everything we needed.\n\nPrior the event, I emailed the restaurant and explained to them my interest in bringing a big party to their restaurant. Typically a big party would require us to rent out their back room however I don't have the budget to afford that so they allowed us to reserve the table in the back room as long as they are able to bring in any outside customers into the back room as well.\n\nWe arrived 30 min early and the staff already had everything ready for us (love!). What I loved about the back room was that it was more secluded and had its own bathroom.\n\nFood came out fairly quickly and quality was so good. We ordered mozerella sticks, tomato soup, buffalo wings for the table. There were some Woodsman burgers and a Bug Doug Burger floating around as well. The burgers were very juicy and flavor, highly rec!"", 'Popped in on a Wednesday before seeing a show at Littlefield. I like the low-key casual vibe here.\n\nI originally wasn\'t planning on getting anything super heavy, but after some persuasion and conversation with the (amazing and friendly) bartender, I ended up with a ""make your own"" style burger. This boy was HUGE. I\'m really glad I went with the salad for the side instead of fries.\n\nThe burger was cooked to perfection (MR) it was juicy and packed with flavor. (I topped mine with chipotle aioli, carmalized onions and cheese).\n\nI opted for a draft cider for HH, though I love that they also had an option for a HH drink + shot special.\n\nOverall, I had an awesome experience and would definitely come back to dine again.', ""We greatly enjoyed our first visit to The Douglass Public House, or The Douglas as it also seems to be known. We were hungry, and with this establishment residing just a block away, it was calling to us! So, we decided to give it another try on this Sunday evening. Last time we ate here, it was very busy, prompting us to make a quick online reservation. As it happened, it wasn't necessary on this visit.\n\nService was very good, and we ordered our dinners:\n\n* Plain Jane Burger (with Swiss): Custom Pat LaFrieda blend and build your own burger from over 20 toppings\n* Personal Chicken Pot Pie\n\nWe very much like the friendly pub ambience here and enjoyed the open windows on this warm evening. Our dinners arrived within about 10 minutes, and we found the burger to be perfectly cooked, and the chicken pot pie to be delicious. There were large chucks of chicken in a lovely sauce, with potatoes and carrots underneath a tasty puff pastry.\nGreat comfort food - just what you would hope to find at a local pub. We look forward to our return."", ""This was the first time in this area of Brooklyn, so we Yelped some restaurants and arrived at The Douglas. It has a pleasant pub type atmosphere, and we were please to be provided an immediate table by the window.  The service was excellent and we opted for the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and a build your own burger with fires. Yes, this would not exactly qualify as a low cal meal! While waiting for our dinners, we were able to take in the old tin ceiling, and rustic pub ambiance of this restaurant. And we liked what we saw.\n\nOur food arrived quickly, and the cheeseburger was fantastic, one of the best burgers we've had in some time. It was perfectly cooked (medium - as in pink, warm and juicy in the middle). The fries were hot and crispy. The grilled cheese sandwich arrived in three halves (1.5 sandwiches) that accompanied the tomato soup. The soup was slightly spicy and very tasty, thick and creamy. The sandwich was delicious, hearty and filling.\n\nWe happened to arrive on the early side, around 4:30. By the time we left, a line was forming, as this seems to be a very popular place. If you're looking for comfort food, check this place out. We'd be happy to return."", 'The food and atmosphere here were amazing! The bartender had a 90s / early 2000s playlist playing, and when we asked the name of a remix, she shared the name and artist, then replayed it for us.\n\nThere is a bar and some tables in the front and what looked like a larger room in the back.\n\nThe food was so delicious! Would definitely go again if back in the area.', ""It's Steven not Stephen. And I still love this place, come here to see me on a Monday soon (I'm the guy at the bar eating a big Doug hanging with cool bartenders).\n\nThe burgers are good, the windows open up wide for a great cross breeze, and the gin and tonics are 5$ on  happy hour. Once in a while, you'll find a live band playing tunes for you, or a comedy show in the back which is a fun change of pace.\n\nAll in all I'm super happy to call this place my go to Monday night local bar, and in all seriousness you should do yourself a favor and make yourself a regular here"", ""Douglas Mondays are my favorite Mondays....and not just because of the all day happy hour they run here (though that sure helps).\n\nFor me this place is pretty much the epitome of a local pub; nothing is fancy, the bartenders (hey Stephen) get to know you quickly, and the food is simple and done well (save the fish n chips....sorry guys not a fan, way too soggy). It's never particularly crowded when I come in, nor is it empty. It's not quiet, nor is it overly loud either. The Douglass just kind of...is. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that; you know exactly what you're getting into when you walk through the door with zero surprises. For me this means gin and tonics (good and strong, thanks again Stephen) for 5$ all night long, and a burger that is pretty damn great; go with the Big Doug (sauce on the side), you can take it apart with a knife and a fork and share it or go to town on it, either way, you win. The Cobb salad is also pretty damn fantastic if you want to pretend to be healthy.\n\nAll and all I am a fan, you can catch me here most Mondays at the bar sipping on GnTs and having them refilled without asking...again, Stephen for the win, you have to appreciate a bartender who knows you."", ""A short walk from the three brewing and a great local bar. I think there was a bachelor's party going on in the backroom.  \n\nI have to start with The Doug burger. It's huge!!! You can just order one and share with someone but it lacks some veggie and and cheese which you can probably add. The fries is decent but a bit small portion. My friends got their tomato soup and another smaller burger. They seems to like them.\n\nI love their beer selection from ipa, cider to my favorite german.

We wanted to show her the Brooklyn Heights area and one of my favorite spots in the area. Upon arrival, we were met with a 45 minute wait, so we grabbed our phone and found Building on Bond (which was a couple blocks east of where we were). We chose to put our names on the list at the spot we were at for dinner seating, but decided to take a trip over to Building on Bond just to grab a drink.\n\nGlad we did, great little spot discovered. The staff was super friendly, the ambiance was great, it wasn't too packed within. The possibility for dining and bar seating was available for 3, so we made out way to the bar. We were met by Chelsea as our bartender. Great energy, she was such a sweetheart and funny, laid back, we all shared stories from our lives and respective relationships and dating situations. She was just cool people. There was just a really chill vibe in there, but definitely a professional service vibe of a real restaurant present.\n\nWe ordered some fries, pan fried brussel sprouts, wine, cocktails, and drinks and just chatted and vibed and killed some time until we got the call from the other restaurant that our table was ready.\n\nSadly, we had to leave. In hindsight I wished we had chosen to stay. The other restaurant was a bit of a let down. The service was pretty pitiful, and to be fair...they were uncanny busy, so I can understand the wait and spacing and all, but out server was a bit bristly, the service was interesting, the food was underdone, and we felt completely neglected and as if they were just waiting for us to leave so the table would be available again. That vibe. In hindsight we should have just stayed at Building on Bond. Much better and much more welcoming vibe.\n\nThe icing on the cake...Upon concluding the night, having had enough wine to float home, I realized I left my man-purse and house keys at Building on Bond. I called the restaurant from the Lyft and got Chelsea on the phone. She remembered us, felt horrible that I left the bag behind and promised to place it in safe keeping until I was able to swing by the restaurant the next morning to retrieve. Took the stress off for the night. I was able to get into my place because my husband had his keys.\nThe next morning, I made my way over to Building on Bond. When I got there, they were so great, had it in their safe, checked ID to make sure it was me, all contents within were undisturbed. The were so kind and sweet and I really appreciate discovering them for the first time less than 24 hours earlier.\n\nI'll be back and probably often. Lovely spot and staff."", ""This is the second time I've been to Building on Bond and honestly it was a weird experience.\nIt took forever to get served. I was starving.

It was kind of rude but I think the waitstaff just wasn't paying attention and didn't intend to be rude.\nAnd then came the absolute strangest thing. Half of our table ordered bread pudding and the other half ordered lemon tarts. Everyone got their bread pudding and then our lemon tarts were just forgotten. Eventually when I said something, we got an apology and they still weren't brought out. When we finally got them they were absolutely runny. We could barely eat them for fear we would get sick. These were not properly cooked lemon tarts or they hadn't been allowed to set. It was super bizarre and we shouldn't have been charged for them.\nIn addition to learning how to bake a lemon tart, I would also recommend this restaurant provide menus versus having waitstaff list off all the ingredients when we are choosing from multiple options. I don't think our waitstaff could remember every tiny ingredient and I would have liked to have a better understanding of what I was ordering. Doesn't seem like too much to ask.

Went into the details of the wine, vineyard, etc.\n\nFood - We started with the gem lettuce and it was fresh, light, and the combination of almonds and green goddess dressing was a good way to start the meal; ordered the burger for main and it was cooked to perfection; the smashed roasted potatoes were the star; simple but done perfectly. Would go again.', ""I came here with a friend because he had a coupon and I would totally recommend this place! It's a bit small so you may need to make a reservation. We ordered the following:\n\nFried Muffins ($5.00): okay, not to exaggerate but these muffins were pretty bomb. The outside was crispy but inside was super soft. I would recommend this as a small appetizer.\n\nOysters on the Half Shell ($17.00): nothing too special about them. They were very tiny though.\n\nWagyu Tartare ($15.00): my friend ate this since I am allergic to beef. He said this was really good too.\n\nGrilled Octopus ($20.00): the octopus was super soft and easy to eat. It was also very flavorful.\n\nPork Shank ($55.00): oh man... let me tell you... the pork falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth. The sauce was extremely unique and paired very well with the meat and veggies. Highly recommend!\n\nThis place is A LITTLE pricey for the portion but I would totally recommend it if you're around the area!"", 'Came here for brunch around 2pm. Unfriendly hostess, staff were not attentive and slow table service.\n\nWe were all disappointed after a 25 minute wait for our food. The biggest disappoint were the pancakes! When the pancakes arrived, it smelled so wonderful and we were so excited. The aroma fooled us though, our tastebuds were met with dry and tasteless bites.\n\nThe 3 of us only finished 1 of the 3 cakes. We did enjoy the cheeseburger, although we felt the burger needed some more texture + flavor. Anyhoo, the scrambled eggs were creamy and dreamy.\n\nCamperdown Elm looked so promising.. perhaps will try dinner in the future.', ""Only been here for brunch and the experience was great! There isn't a lot of people so while I made a reservation you could probably just walk-in.\n\nI loved their pancake and I can say it's definitely one of the best I've ever had. The aroma literally penetrates the restaurant (it's not too big of a restaurant and not a lot of people for brunch) and you see the waitress this delicious pancake that's still smoking because it's so fresh! The coconut hazelnut praline was definitely a good mixture because you initially only taste the hazelnut but at the very end you feel the coconut spread in your mouth. These pancakes are thickkk so they suck all the syrup away. If you're like me make sure to ask for more syrup! Trust me, the syrup isn't crazy sweet so you wouldn't feel too gross afterwards, only happiness!\n\nTheir deviled eggs were so amazing too. I never had deviled eggs that really stood out to me but the ones they served were SO DELICIOUS. Perhaps the mackerel pate did the magic!"", 'This was our second visit and we will certainly be back. It has a very cozy, neighborhood vibe. The servers are attentive and very informed about the menu - food and wine.  The cocktails are creative so I suggest that you give them a try.\n\nWe had small plates and shared entree for two.  I thoroughly enjoyed the small appetizers and the entree.  The dessert was the perfect complement to the meal! Cheers!', ""First time here but definitely a fan! This is your place if you like American or Asian fusion!\n\nWe made a two person reservation for Saturday night. When we arrived, the indoor seating was filled and the restaurant had not reserved our table. The staff member apologized to us and sat us at the bar. We got the first round of cocktails for free, which was very nice of them.\n\nThe interior was very small but cozy and intimate. It definitely had a local neighborhood feel to it. There was only maybe around 8 small tables inside but there were a couple of outdoor seats. We decided to stay seated at the bar for the rest of the evening.\n\nFor pre-dinner cocktail, I had the Harmony, which was a blend of matcha, gin, and green chartreuse. I liked it because I'm not a fan of overly sweet or strong cocktails. It was quite mild and was served in a matcha tea cup.\n\nWe decided to share a couple of starters and one entree. We were quite full at the end. I do not recommend the shishito peppers on their bar food menu. The peppers were overly charred and mostly burnt. It was not a pleasant starter but the rest of the dinner course redeemed itself.\n\nI love pâté so we ordered their chicken liver with jelly-like plum wine and a layer of pear panna cotta. It was a perfect balance of sweet and savory on crispy buttery baguette. We also ordered the Spanish Mackerel pâté, which was served on a rice cracker. I highly recommend it! The pâté had a tart taste that resembled sun dried tomatoes and the smooth texture of hummus with just a hint of fishy taste.\n\nWe were recommended the grilled octopus on BBQ potatoes and blood sausages. This place does octopus right!!! It was the highlight of our dinner! The octopus was so soft but had a slight charred crunchy crisp to it. The potatoes mixed well with the blood sausages, which reminded us of a black bean sauce.\n\nWe also ordered the Japanese inspired Hamachi with Asian pear and Myoga, a type of Japanese ginger. It was savory with sweetness from the Asian pear and had a dash of saltiness and yuzu fragrance. For our entree, we had the grassfed beef with mushrooms and topped with turnip slices. The buttery beef was a nicely done medium-rare and dressed with a tart, sweet soy-like sauce.\n\nFinally, we finished with the miso semifreddo with passion fruit and sansho pepper. It was a well chosen closer to our meal! This was also recommended to us by the staff. It looked like a block of tofu with syrup topping but don't let it fool you! It was very creamy but not overly heavy or sweet.\n\nCamperdown Elm is very worth the trek to Brooklyn for a very good treat-yourself! If you so happen to live in this area, you're in luck!"", ""Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Tiny space but we're able to get sat quickly. Very cute aesthetic, I bet sitting on their teal chairs outside in the summer would be enjoyable. I got the single French press, which is a great idea that I haven't found in a lot of places! You get to push the stopper and pour yourself. My partner and I got the egg sandwich as well as the mortadella sandwich, and when we expressed to the waiter we intended to share- they brought out plates with 1/2 of each sandwich on them for easy sharing! The brioche on the sandwiches was delicious! I preferred the egg sandwich but the mortadella was very good also. So reasonably priced and delicious food, would come back if in the area!"", ""Quaint little spot in park slope. Came here on a Thursday for date night and was greeted by a friendly waitress. Cozy interior design this is an awesome place for a quiet night. They have a good cocktail and drink menu. My wife tried the fallkill drink and I had a glass of red wine. Great drinks. We noticed from other reviews about the muffins so we tried them as well. Tasty and light the muffins were a great appetizer. I had the Covina and she had the squash dish. Both dishes were very enjoyable. Overall the setting and mood was quiet and romantic, just what we were looking for. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable (I believe the manager poured us my wine and explained a little about the winery). Unfortunately, we did mis happy hour $1 oysters... so we'll be back to try that :)"", 'J and I had dinner here last night, thanks to a coupon gifted to us by our friends, and it was a great experience. (My rating is probably 4.5 for the food alone, but the excellent service and ambiance push it up to a 5.)\n\nThey feature a small dinner menu divided into three sections, starting with smaller plates, then working up to heavier appetizers, and finally a selection of entrees. Rather than order from all three, we started with a cocktail and the wagyu beef tartare appetizer, which was served with house-made chips. I was a little unsure about ordering it, mainly because we were both planning to order beef as our entree, but it was one of the best, unique tastes of the night. As for the beef entree, it was served with kolhrabi and two types of mushrooms, and was rich and satisfying.\n\nNonetheless, we still had room for dessert, and since there were two options, we got both and shared. They had a ""key lime"" pie made with yuzu, and a miso semifreddo. Both were surprisingly light, refreshing finishes to the meal--after eating everything I described above, I didn\'t leave feeling overly stuffed.\n\nBesides the creative and exciting flavor combinations, the place had a friendly, laid-back vibe, and I could definitely see myself coming back for dinner or brunch, or even just for drinks. My friends know it takes a lot for me to go to Brooklyn, but Camperdown Elm is well worth the trek!', ""I had a great dinner here a weeknight last week.\n\nFood - we had 4 dishes to share, all but one of which exceeded my expectations.\nGrilled Monkfish: delicious skewer, very tender\nKobe Tartare: I found the heat (spice) in this dish a very pleasant surprise, unique flavors that you usually don't find in a classic tartare, which made it even better; served with chips which were fine but I could have just eaten the tartare on its own\nOctopus with Morcilla: both of our favorite dish hands down, the flavors melded so well and the sauce was basically all morcilla (blood sausage); it was meaty and light at the same time\nPork Shank: this was the only dish that was more of a 4.75 star; the pork itself was cooked to perfection and the sauce complemented the meat but the veggies (shishito peppers and rutabaga) felt like they were just added onto the plate and didn't exactly match well with the other flavors; that being said, the vegetables were cooked very well on their own and were delicious, just not as cohesive dish\n\nWine - we both got the wine pairings and were given a couple of recommendations for a couple of wines depending on what we ordered. We ended up with a Riesling blend from Oregon that had a unique almost savory finish and a chilled red from Spain (?) - I personally love chilled reds so I'm biased and they're not a normal way of serving reds so I was very pleased to find this here. We ended the meal with a bold red that I don't recall being all that special, but overall the wines were great and paired very well with the food.\n\nService - this was amazing. The manager was on the floor (or maybe owner?), in any case, the service was outstanding: attentive but not overbearing. Other reviews said that the service really brought this up to a five star review, and I couldn't agree more.\n\nAmbiance - it was cozy and very pleasant, not gimmicky and true to the neighborhood.\n\nIt was an amazing meal and a very nice experience. I had a Time Out coupon that helped with the price but it would have been worth it even without!""]",113,"['Amazing meal; Cosy set up; Service was great; Owner or Manager was very conversational while opening and serving us our bottle of wine... Went into the details of the wine, vineyard, etc.\n\nFood - We started with the gem lettuce and it was fresh, light, and the combination of almonds and green goddess dressing was a good way to start the meal; ordered the burger for main and it was cooked to perfection; the smashed roasted potatoes were the star; simple but done perfectly. Would go again.', ""I came here with a friend because he had a coupon and I would totally recommend this place! It's a bit small so you may need to make a reservation. We ordered the following:\n\nFried Muffins ($5.00): okay, not to exaggerate but these muffins were pretty bomb. The outside was crispy but inside was super soft. I would recommend this as a small appetizer.\n\nOysters on the Half Shell ($17.00): nothing too special about them. They were very tiny though.\n\nWagyu Tartare ($15.00): my friend ate this since I am allergic to beef. He said this was really good too.\n\nGrilled Octopus ($20.00): the octopus was super soft and easy to eat. It was also very flavorful.\n\nPork Shank ($55.00): oh man... let me tell you... the pork falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth. The sauce was extremely unique and paired very well with the meat and veggies. Highly recommend!\n\nThis place is A LITTLE pricey for the portion but I would totally recommend it if you're around the area!"", 'Came here for brunch around 2pm. Unfriendly hostess, staff were not attentive and slow table service.\n\nWe were all disappointed after a 25 minute wait for our food. The biggest disappoint were the pancakes! When the pancakes arrived, it smelled so wonderful and we were so excited. The aroma fooled us though, our tastebuds were met with dry and tasteless bites.\n\nThe 3 of us only finished 1 of the 3 cakes. We did enjoy the cheeseburger, although we felt the burger needed some more texture + flavor. Anyhoo, the scrambled eggs were creamy and dreamy.\n\nCamperdown Elm looked so promising.. perhaps will try dinner in the future.', ""Only been here for brunch and the experience was great! There isn't a lot of people so while I made a reservation you could probably just walk-in.\n\nI loved their pancake and I can say it's definitely one of the best I've ever had. The aroma literally penetrates the restaurant (it's not too big of a restaurant and not a lot of people for brunch) and you see the waitress this delicious pancake that's still smoking because it's so fresh! The coconut hazelnut praline was definitely a good mixture because you initially only taste the hazelnut but at the very end you feel the coconut spread in your mouth. These pancakes are thickkk so they suck all the syrup away. If you're like me make sure to ask for more syrup! Trust me, the syrup isn't crazy sweet so you wouldn't feel too gross afterwards, only happiness!\n\nTheir deviled eggs were so amazing too. I never had deviled eggs that really stood out to me but the ones they served were SO DELICIOUS. Perhaps the mackerel pate did the magic!"", 'This was our second visit and we will certainly be back. It has a very cozy, neighborhood vibe. The servers are attentive and very informed about the menu - food and wine.  The cocktails are creative so I suggest that you give them a try.\n\nWe had small plates and shared entree for two.  I thoroughly enjoyed the small appetizers and the entree.  The dessert was the perfect complement to the meal! Cheers!', ""First time here but definitely a fan! This is your place if you like American or Asian fusion!\n\nWe made a two person reservation for Saturday night. When we arrived, the indoor seating was filled and the restaurant had not reserved our table. The staff member apologized to us and sat us at the bar. We got the first round of cocktails for free, which was very nice of them.\n\nThe interior was very small but cozy and intimate. It definitely had a local neighborhood feel to it. There was only maybe around 8 small tables inside but there were a couple of outdoor seats. We decided to stay seated at the bar for the rest of the evening.\n\nFor pre-dinner cocktail, I had the Harmony, which was a blend of matcha, gin, and green chartreuse. I liked it because I'm not a fan of overly sweet or strong cocktails. It was quite mild and was served in a matcha tea cup.\n\nWe decided to share a couple of starters and one entree. We were quite full at the end. I do not recommend the shishito peppers on their bar food menu. The peppers were overly charred and mostly burnt. It was not a pleasant starter but the rest of the dinner course redeemed itself.\n\nI love pâté so we ordered their chicken liver with jelly-like plum wine and a layer of pear panna cotta. It was a perfect balance of sweet and savory on crispy buttery baguette. We also ordered the Spanish Mackerel pâté, which was served on a rice cracker. I highly recommend it! The pâté had a tart taste that resembled sun dried tomatoes and the smooth texture of hummus with just a hint of fishy taste.\n\nWe were recommended the grilled octopus on BBQ potatoes and blood sausages. This place does octopus right!!! It was the highlight of our dinner! The octopus was so soft but had a slight charred crunchy crisp to it. The potatoes mixed well with the blood sausages, which reminded us of a black bean sauce.\n\nWe also ordered the Japanese inspired Hamachi with Asian pear and Myoga, a type of Japanese ginger. It was savory with sweetness from the Asian pear and had a dash of saltiness and yuzu fragrance. For our entree, we had the grassfed beef with mushrooms and topped with turnip slices. The buttery beef was a nicely done medium-rare and dressed with a tart, sweet soy-like sauce.\n\nFinally, we finished with the miso semifreddo with passion fruit and sansho pepper. It was a well chosen closer to our meal! This was also recommended to us by the staff. It looked like a block of tofu with syrup topping but don't let it fool you! It was very creamy but not overly heavy or sweet.\n\nCamperdown Elm is very worth the trek to Brooklyn for a very good treat-yourself! If you so happen to live in this area, you're in luck!"", ""Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Tiny space but we're able to get sat quickly. Very cute aesthetic, I bet sitting on their teal chairs outside in the summer would be enjoyable. I got the single French press, which is a great idea that I haven't found in a lot of places! You get to push the stopper and pour yourself. My partner and I got the egg sandwich as well as the mortadella sandwich, and when we expressed to the waiter we intended to share- they brought out plates with 1/2 of each sandwich on them for easy sharing! The brioche on the sandwiches was delicious! I preferred the egg sandwich but the mortadella was very good also. So reasonably priced and delicious food, would come back if in the area!"", ""Quaint little spot in park slope. Came here on a Thursday for date night and was greeted by a friendly waitress. Cozy interior design this is an awesome place for a quiet night. They have a good cocktail and drink menu. My wife tried the fallkill drink and I had a glass of red wine. Great drinks. We noticed from other reviews about the muffins so we tried them as well. Tasty and light the muffins were a great appetizer. I had the Covina and she had the squash dish. Both dishes were very enjoyable. Overall the setting and mood was quiet and romantic, just what we were looking for. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable (I believe the manager poured us my wine and explained a little about the winery). Unfortunately, we did mis happy hour $1 oysters... so we'll be back to try that :)"", 'J and I had dinner here last night, thanks to a coupon gifted to us by our friends, and it was a great experience. (My rating is probably 4.5 for the food alone, but the excellent service and ambiance push it up to a 5.)\n\nThey feature a small dinner menu divided into three sections, starting with smaller plates, then working up to heavier appetizers, and finally a selection of entrees. Rather than order from all three, we started with a cocktail and the wagyu beef tartare appetizer, which was served with house-made chips. I was a little unsure about ordering it, mainly because we were both planning to order beef as our entree, but it was one of the best, unique tastes of the night. As for the beef entree, it was served with kolhrabi and two types of mushrooms, and was rich and satisfying.\n\nNonetheless, we still had room for dessert, and since there were two options, we got both and shared.

I usually get the chicken shwarma on this unique rye pita, but there are a ton of sides you can opt for to switch things up...soup, salads, pickles, cabbage, an assortment of spreads and obviously a dessert.\n\nOh and the zaatar chicken wings.

As expected the bar was pretty packed with all but three stools taken, but what wasn't expected was the size of this restaurant. In the front is their main bar section that also has adjoining booths nearby where you're able to order food service, along with beverages. In the back however they have a much larger dining area that also has what looked to be a stage?

Prices are great, food and drinks quality even better and service is good, too. Decor and ambiance great, too. Highly recommend this place!"", ""Where did this place come from? I came to see my friend Roman play at this place (it has a pretty cool live music stage) but I'm really not familiar with the area. It's probably my first time in this part of Brooklyn. After walking a few blocks from the Morgan Av. station, which is really out in the middle of nothing, I see the entrance to Guadalupe Inn right on the corner. When I walked through the door I was left in awe. The place is huge and gorgeous. Nicely lit and decorated, full of beautiful people and great-looking dishes. This has to be the neighborhood gem.\nI ordered the Sopa Azteca, which I was thrilled to find on the menu. Also known as Tortilla Soup in other restaurants, this tomato-based soup has avocado, Oaxaca cheese, shredded chicken and, of course, crispy tortilla strips. Here, they make the tortilla strips really really thin, almost like matchsticks and throw a lot of them in there. The soup was good but not great. The consistency was a bit too liquid for my taste and compared to the best one I've had (Cafe Frida-UWS), it left me underwhelmed. My main course was a totally different story. By suggestion of the wonderful hostess, I ordered the Enchiladas Verdes con Carne. Wow! Saucy, tasty, with perfectly seasoned and cooked pieces of steak, it's gotta be one of the best dishes in the house.\n\nI'm not drinking today but I did see the drinks being served, and I can't wait to come back and try some of their exotic margaritas and mixologist-made cocktails.\n\nIf you live in the area or even if you have to jump in the subway for a few stations, check out Guadalupe Inn. The place is gorgeous and the staff could not be friendlier and welcoming."", ""I would rate Guadalupe Inn four and a half stars.\n\nOne of the features that makes this restaurant unique is that they have live music in the back of the restaurant. They had a small, three member group playing some mellow Latin and American songs. They seemed to trend on the folky side. It was a neat feature since I haven't been to many restaurants with live entertainment.\n\nThey have a nice bar with a great mezcal selection. I had La Venesora. I would highly recommend it. It was aromatic and smokey, yet incredibly smooth. They have some high end mezclas pouring for $35-40 per 2 oz.\n\nFood wise, we shared the guacamole. Simply and fresh guac. The chips were house made. They were super crispy. I think they may have been fried multiple times. For our main course, my fiancée had the enchiladas verdes while I had the barbacoa. I highly recommend the barbacoa. The lamb was super tender and juicy. It was absolutely delicious."", ""Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends for dinner and we loved it!\nThis place is really cool, I believe every night they have some kind of live music or performance here, expect Sunday's.\nIt was a bit empty when we went, but It was a Sunday night. The service was amazing, they answered our questions and were attentive.\n\nWe started with the guacamole and chips. The chips were warm when they came out, which was a nice touch.\n\nMy friends got the chicken and carnita tacos and I ended up with the enchilada with steak. Everything was fresh and delicious! The enchilada had a nice kick. My friends said the tacos were good and nicely seasoned.\n\nFor dessert. We ended up getting the churros and flan. They were both delicious, not too sweet and they were just really good.\n\nAll in all I would love to come back here with my friends again for a night with the live performances."", 'I came here twice.

The food was delicious.The service was top.\nLatin Jazz night was pretty cool and the tacos was excellent.\nWill be back for more!', ""I would just like to start off with saying how understanding and accommodating this establishment is. My boyfriend and I decided this would be a good place for dinner after an hour of gym fun with a group of friends. We made reservations for 8. Things were going well, but now we were running 15 minutes late and 2 of us decided to head back early. So now we're late AND down 2 people. Hostess called me up and asked if we were still coming. I told her about the situation and she said that was perfectly fine!\n\nWhen we got there, we were seated immediately. We had a large booth and an extra table all to ourselves. It wasn't super packed when we arrived, but people started piling in an hour later, so thank goodness we made reservations! The interior is dimly lit, so it's an intimate and date-night worthy spot, for sure. All the way at the back is a performance stage with a velvet backdrop that was absolutely beautiful! And the booths and tables are all arranged in a way that allows everyone to see what's going on at all times.\n\nThe food was delicious. I ordered the half chicken, and the drumstick was very flavorful and juicy. The actually chicken body with the wing, though, was a little dry, so it was difficult trying to cut into it. My boyfriend ordered a soup dish that looked yummy (to me) and tasted yummy (to him). I also ordered the watermelon margarita and it had the right amount of watermelon flavor to it. My boyfriend ordered the tequila flight and it came with grasshoppers! Be sure to try it out if you've never tried grasshoppers before! It was my first time and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.\n\nWould definitely come back if we're in the neighborhood (and with just the 2 of us)!""]",186,"['I came here for brunch with my best friend and it was great! Customer service is top notch, the food was cooked well and the drinks were tasty. Definitely going back after this quarantine is over lol', 'Most amazing gluten free beer battered fish tacos. Food is fresh and great fast service too! So happy they are open again!', ""I was looking for a new Mexican spot for a friend's birthday. She is partial to great margaritas and tacos. I found this place on of course yelp and after the pictures I was game.\n\nThis place is super stylish...the decor, the lighting, and colors make it very low key sexy. We actually went during a performance with is an extra $10 (the charge is not my fav thing... but it's cool).\n\nFood on the table...Queso Fondido w/ steak, ensalade guadalupe inn, steak tacos, fish tacos, & chiicken enchiladas.\nCocktails on the table...traditional & mezcal pineapple margarita, the last kiss, and something else. All i can say everything was inhaled and ingested....EVERYTHING!!!\n\nThey also sang a very jazzy rendition of happy birthday to my friend that was so sweet. I will definitely be back!!"", ""I found myself at Guadalupe trying to kill time before attending an event in the area. I thought finding a bar here might be difficult given that it's heavily residential but I found this unassuming spot on a street corner and was saved!\n\nI walked in around 6 on Friday evening. As expected the bar was pretty packed with all but three stools taken, but what wasn't expected was the size of this restaurant. In the front is their main bar section that also has adjoining booths nearby where you're able to order food service, along with beverages. In the back however they have a much larger dining area that also has what looked to be a stage? Not sure if they host live events here but it's worth checking out if they do!\n\nWhen it came time to order I choose the on draft IPA option. Since it was happy hour their draft beers were only $4! Good body and not too mild it was a pretty good selection.\n\nSeems like a nice neighborhood bar to grab a drink with a friend and catch up! Try it if you're nearby."", ""Amazing Mexican restaurant. Food is so delicious and very authentic. Drinks are even better, I'm very picky with my margaritas, and theirs didn't disappoint. Their live music was phenomenal, added a very special touch to the whole experience.\n\nNot sure why it has 4 stars only. Prices are great, food and drinks quality even better and service is good, too. Decor and ambiance great, too. Highly recommend this place!"", ""Where did this place come from? I came to see my friend Roman play at this place (it has a pretty cool live music stage) but I'm really not familiar with the area. It's probably my first time in this part of Brooklyn. After walking a few blocks from the Morgan Av. station, which is really out in the middle of nothing, I see the entrance to Guadalupe Inn right on the corner. When I walked through the door I was left in awe. The place is huge and gorgeous. Nicely lit and decorated, full of beautiful people and great-looking dishes. This has to be the neighborhood gem.\nI ordered the Sopa Azteca, which I was thrilled to find on the menu. Also known as Tortilla Soup in other restaurants, this tomato-based soup has avocado, Oaxaca cheese, shredded chicken and, of course, crispy tortilla strips. Here, they make the tortilla strips really really thin, almost like matchsticks and throw a lot of them in there. The soup was good but not great. The consistency was a bit too liquid for my taste and compared to the best one I've had (Cafe Frida-UWS), it left me underwhelmed. My main course was a totally different story. By suggestion of the wonderful hostess, I ordered the Enchiladas Verdes con Carne. Wow! Saucy, tasty, with perfectly seasoned and cooked pieces of steak, it's gotta be one of the best dishes in the house.\n\nI'm not drinking today but I did see the drinks being served, and I can't wait to come back and try some of their exotic margaritas and mixologist-made cocktails.\n\nIf you live in the area or even if you have to jump in the subway for a few stations, check out Guadalupe Inn. The place is gorgeous and the staff could not be friendlier and welcoming."", ""I would rate Guadalupe Inn four and a half stars.\n\nOne of the features that makes this restaurant unique is that they have live music in the back of the restaurant. They had a small, three member group playing some mellow Latin and American songs. They seemed to trend on the folky side. It was a neat feature since I haven't been to many restaurants with live entertainment.\n\nThey have a nice bar with a great mezcal selection. I had La Venesora. I would highly recommend it. It was aromatic and smokey, yet incredibly smooth. They have some high end mezclas pouring for $35-40 per 2 oz.\n\nFood wise, we shared the guacamole. Simply and fresh guac. The chips were house made. They were super crispy. I think they may have been fried multiple times. For our main course, my fiancée had the enchiladas verdes while I had the barbacoa. I highly recommend the barbacoa. The lamb was super tender and juicy. It was absolutely delicious."", ""Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends for dinner and we loved it!\nThis place is really cool, I believe every night they have some kind of live music or performance here, expect Sunday's.\nIt was a bit empty when we went, but It was a Sunday night. The service was amazing, they answered our questions and were attentive.\n\nWe started with the guacamole and chips. The chips were warm when they came out, which was a nice touch.\n\nMy friends got the chicken and carnita tacos and I ended up with the enchilada with steak. Everything was fresh and delicious! The enchilada had a nice kick. My friends said the tacos were good and nicely seasoned.\n\nFor dessert. We ended up getting the churros and flan. They were both delicious, not too sweet and they were just really good.\n\nAll in all I would love to come back here with my friends again for a night with the live performances."", 'I came here twice. Once with my date and the second alone, today, here now.\nWe both enjoyed it. Burlesque night was a surprise but it was fun and different. The food was delicious.The service was top.\nLatin Jazz night was pretty cool and the tacos was excellent.\nWill be back for more!', ""I would just like to start off with saying how understanding and accommodating this establishment is. My boyfriend and I decided this would be a good place for dinner after an hour of gym fun with a group of friends. We made reservations for 8. Things were going well, but now we were running 15 minutes late and 2 of us decided to head back early. So now we're late AND down 2 people. Hostess called me up and asked if we were still coming. I told her about the situation and she said that was perfectly fine!\n\nWhen we got there, we were seated immediately. We had a large booth and an extra table all to ourselves. It wasn't super packed when we arrived, but people started piling in an hour later, so thank goodness we made reservations! The interior is dimly lit, so it's an intimate and date-night worthy spot, for sure. All the way at the back is a performance stage with a velvet backdrop that was absolutely beautiful! And the booths and tables are all arranged in a way that allows everyone to see what's going on at all times.\n\nThe food was delicious. I ordered the half chicken, and the drumstick was very flavorful and juicy. The actually chicken body with the wing, though, was a little dry, so it was difficult trying to cut into it. My boyfriend ordered a soup dish that looked yummy (to me) and tasted yummy (to him). I also ordered the watermelon margarita and it had the right amount of watermelon flavor to it. My boyfriend ordered the tequila flight and it came with grasshoppers! Be sure to try it out if you've never tried grasshoppers before!

We have an actual gyro in the neighborhood.\n\nThere are a lot of places that claim to serve gyros, but this is what I\'m talking about. Sumela has the thin slices of browned, tasty meat carved off straight off a spit. So flavorful. So good.\n\nThe rice, babaghanouj, and bread are all excellent as well, but I would recommend getting the salad with your meal, otherwise it seems like you\'ve got a gigantic container of meat. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, unless you don\'t want heart disease.\n\nWhile the lunch special is still pretty pricey, it\'s nice that the ""small"" is plenty of food for anyone at lunch.\n\nI will be eating here embarrassingly often.', 'High quality delicious Turkish food! Really fresh ingredients. I loved the chicken soup and the chicken Adana wrap. Wrap was grilled to perfection. Great portion sizes. Highly recommend for delivery or takeout! Delivery came in less than 20 minutes.', ""One can only expect a chicken gyro to come on a pita, right? Well that's what I ordered but definitely not what I got. I got more like a burrito with chicken in it. For such a simple order on my first try of Sumela, I was disappointed and won't be back. Ordered a chicken Gyro with white sauce and onions only to get a Gyro with sautéed yellow onions no white sauce and on a wrap instead of in a traditional Pita as they normally come. Had a few bites and just tossed the rest very disappointed."", 'I came in for lunch around 12ish, there was no one in the restaurant, I was a little nervous, but once I smelled the food and noticed some of the desserts I was sold, had the kofte wrap and Turkish yougurt soup.I definitely will be back for lunch, the lady working at the counter was very nice as well!', ""I asked for 2 orders of just plain falafel. I double checked with them that they were not charging me for the actual entree which came with salad and bread and hummus and was more expensive. I just wanted a plain order of falafel. They assured me they weren't and charged me $22 for 10 minuscule balls of falafel that came soaked in a tub of hummus and tahini, with salad and bread--a veritable entree that I neither wanted nor had ordered. In fact, it was what I had explicitly not asked for.\n\nDo not go here, they take forever, overcharge, and overdress the food. You can find much better Middle Eastern/Turkish/Mediterranean food in Brooklyn, especially somewhere that will actually listen to its customers."", 'Among a number of good Middle Eastern restaurants on Atlantic Ave, this is a Turkish fast-casual and take-out place.  Food is on par quality-wise with the other Turkish restaurants in the area, but quicker. A great option when on the go. I particularly liked their kebabs. Very reasonably priced.', 'I just went there today and I loved this place. Vibe is good, waitstaff is friendly and nice, and last but not least portions are good for the price!\nI got the lamb gyro wrap. When I saw it was 8$ I was happy, but when I saw how much meat they put in there, I was happier. It did not disappoint my expectations.\nIf you are hanging out or shopping by the area, pay them a visit.', 'I think this place is fantastic - having been to Turkey numerous times I can credibly say this is very authentic Turkish food. I am a huge fan of the chicken doner (like a gyro but with chicken), very flavorful, perfectly seasoned and has a bit of those delicious browned crispy bits. I prefer the platter / with rice option (and the rice is really great too) - the costs are a little on the high side but the portions are ample so definitely take that into consideration.\n\nAlso, the Shepards Salad, Eggplant and Muhamara is super delish. Make sure you order lots of sides (mezzes) as well since they really make it a Turkish feast!', 'Seems like a new addition to Court Street, right across Trader Joe\'s. Their outside sandwich board sign said ""eggplant casserole"". I did some shopping, got goodies from Damascus Bakery and then returned to Sumela To Go. I asked if they still had the eggplant casserole and if there was meat in it. Woman said yes - lamb. I wanted something either vegan or vegetarian. So my spouse and I, being hungry for a midday meal, opted for two orders of Kuru Fasulye (white beans and rice).\nBuyer beware: Here is what we got for $12.99:\n1.

Actually, I can only recommend it because that is what I had during my visit; I'm sure the other selections are just as tasty.\n\nAlthough I dined here on a Sunday, I would image that this place would be quite packed on weekdays. There is seating at Korilla, but it gives me more of take-out vibe because the seating arrangement looks a bit awkward."", 'This is my first time eating Korean BBQ, so I was unsure of what to expect at first. Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed with their decor as well as the cafeteria style service. It is very similar to that of Chipotle.\n\nI had a bowl with Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice, Ginger Soy Chicken, Pico de Gallo, Blue Potato Salad (this was different for sure), and the Red Kimchi.\n\nI would definitely return here, however it is not a restaurant I would be able to eat at regularly. Korilla is a place that is a nice change of pace and scenery.', 'Probably due to my low expectations, I am pretty surprised how good this place is. I ordered wild rice with steak, tofu ($3 more).

Throw on top of the eclectic decor some 90s rock, some Spanish music ambiance in a chocolateria that specializes in drinks esp hot chocolate and tea.\n\nI got a Nutella latte and it was petite but perfect. It was pricey so I made sure to soak in some ambiance too. The chocolate candies and desserts left little to be desired as they look old and dry this morning. I hope that is not always the case.\n\nThere is a bonus room in the back for a lovely private meeting or even a small gathering of any size less than 20.', ""Chocolateria is a charming and comfortable spot to enjoy a cup of joe, tea or hot chocolate. Their case has a nice array of sweet treats (they have vegan and non-vegan options). I'd recommend getting one to accompany your beverage. I was pleased to find a few upholstered cushioned chairs (like you'd find in a living room), as I find this adds to the cozy and welcoming feel. When you dine in, they give you a real mug and saucer... another charming touch.\n\nOrdered:\n\nRed Kiss tea: I visited Chocolateria in the evening so I decided to order an herbal tea since it doesn't have caffeine. This tea was so good, I would order it morning or night. The ingredients included strawberries, apples and vanilla. It was fruity with the added warmth of vanilla. I highly recommend it.\n\nBiscotti: The biscotti has almonds and was good dipped in the tea. The only downside was how small it was.\n\nI thought my tea and biscotti were priced fairly (both came to around $5.50) but I noticed that some of the specialty drinks were quite a bit more expensive. If I'm in the neighborhood and feeling like splurging, I'll take some of the other reviewers' advice and try one of the specialty drinks.\n\nIf you are looking for a comfortable coffee shop to enjoy a good book or catch up with a friend, I'd recommend Chocolateria."", ""First time. There's something off about this place. A friend wanted to have our meeting there. When I first walked in I thought the space was super cute, we were able to sit in the window, very cozy yet spacious. When I went to order the server was fine, but my drip coffee was lukewarm and had grounds in it. When I asked to pay for a refill, they said they don't offer that. Bummer. No refills for DRIP COFFEE??\n\nI discovered the back portion of the cafe and noticed that a backyard existed as I went to the bathroom. I really wish I could put my finger on it, but there's some bad energy swirling around that spot. Will NOT be returning (even though it was nice for our work date and the organic banana bread was fresh and yummy.)"", ""Get the Mocha Latte.\n\nShhhh....\n\nJust do it. It does cost a pretty penny.\n\nDon't think about it.\n\nOrder a small. Swipe/insert your card.  \n\nIt's the richest Mocha I've tasted. It's too good.\n\nI also like the herb and goat cheese quiche.\n\nYou can come to this spot and get some reading or work done.\n\nEspecially now that there is some more seating due to the recent remodel.\n\nSitting at the bar is my thing. High seating, working on my laptop and reading- so it's perfect\n\nAnd - cause I've been there 100times- I find it's the best place to get the best service."", ""Was walking around after an appointment enjoying the weather, and decided to stop here to grab a coffee. It turned out to be so adorable and had so many fun chocolate options. I want to go back to try them all, or get some gifts. We ended up getting a ricotta croissant with I think rosemary on top, and OMG it was divine. Need to come back here next time I'm in the neighborhood!"", 'I\'ve been here several times. Imagine coming here on a Saturday and listening to several teenagers discussing philosophy and Kant over $100 of coffee and chocolates.  The patrons are fine and well behaved and there\'s no rowdiness. If they\'re wealthy enough to sit around and consume small $6.50 cups of coffee and tea, it\'s good for the economy and I think it\'s wonderful for everyone.\n\nI do always sense some rushed negative energy from the woman who works there - even when there is no line. It\'s like she wants me to order and get the heck out as soon as possible. I\'ll walk in and immediately hear her say ""Are you ready to order?"" and if I order immediately - she\'ll cut me off and say ""okay great is that all?"" even if she sees someone with me.\n\nI mean - i\'m spending $25 for two cups of tea and two pieces of chocolate but she needs me to order and get the heck out of line within 5-10 seconds! It\'s absurd. My only conclusion is one I don\'t want to make. Although I always come in here well dressed...i\'m always going to look out of place compared to 99% of the patrons here.', ""Great service and atmosphere\nThe backyard is perfect as fuck\nThe chocolate cake is he base for all chocolate desserts and that's the only negative so far\nWill return and check out everything else\nThey were closing up when I came in so they were imout if a few options""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chocolateria-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=6RjfNv845yTuVsdmVIEvnQ&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=6RjfNv845yTuVsdmVIEvnQ

I normally just get smoothies in the mornings since there isn't many spots like that in the area.

This place, is not just halal, but is serving up some really good food.\n\nThis cafe has slot of seating and was able to sit a party of 7 easily (before quarantine). I appreciate their short menu because they give you a few options of foods from different categories to satisfy your craving but it's not overwhelming with options. Simplicity means a lot to me.\n\nWe had avocado toast, tots, steak and egg, bacon and egg, pancakes, french toast, coffee, hot chocolate, and ice coffees. Though the tots needed more seasoning the food was really delicious and fresh to order. The wait times was not long either.\n\nThe barista though did not make my latte to my liking. If your paying five bucks for a mug of coffee I'd expect the latte art to be on point and it wasn't. That's one of the things I look forward to when eating at a cafe. I hope they got that fixed. I definitely recommend this restaurant and I will come back again."", ""All per store staff: The owner changed the name from Cocoa Grinder because of an apparent disagreement with the owners of the other Cocoa Grinders.

We did refund your money for the missing item and apologize for any inconvenience. Stay safe and god bless.', ""Yesterday I had to work at a studio nearby so I stopped here for breakfast I got this delicious steak and eggs sandwich with tatertots for a very reasonable price ... not only did I pay like less than half price for something you'd get at a cafe in TriBeCa but the quality of the food was superb and cooked at perfect temperature. Was so impressed that I came back the next day for delicious french toast and well I had a craving for turkey sausage too so I had some with fried eggs to balance it out. And everything was cooked to pure perfection. I even had some of their refreshing teas while dining and on the go. And the ladies working the registers and serving my food were so polite and assured that I was properly satisfied. I highly recommend this place to everyone.... especially to my fellow Bushwick artists."", 'Hey Frank! Thank you for the great review! Glad our staff and food was beyond your expectations! Hope we can make a regular out of you!', ""This is my go to place for food and coffee since I've moved to Brooklyn. I live a few blocks down and the staff has been absolutely welcoming and so kind every single time I walk in. If coffee wasn't the best part it's probably worth noting that I  sit on the same couch every single time and have a whole routine that is the highlight of my day.

Pictures and menu looked promising so I gave it a shot. Walked into a dimly lit bar with some booths available in the front and little tables throughout the cozy place, but we opted for the seats at the bar (closer to the alcohol, you know how we do). Lunch specials had a few choices of entrees like burgers and chicken sandwiches, along with your choice of either mimosa or bloody mary. Gave the chicken sandwich a shot and honestly, it came out crispy and fresh on a bed of french fries. The bun was nicely toasted and the chicken was slightly coated with honey (more honey on the side in case you wanted more). I was content with the meal and price ($12) of our lunch specials and would definitely stop by again whenever im around the area and want a quick fix of HH/food', ""Hey, Bryant. We completely understand that location is key -- especially in regard to happy hour. If you're ever in need of a solid meal, you know where to find us.\n\nUntil then,\nJames R., Owner"", ""We came in here for a bite to eat and walked into a hidden treasure spot. We chose to try the cheeseburger and fries from the happy hour menu based on Akee, one of the bartender's recommendation. The cheeseburger was so good that my friend decided to order another one lol.\n\nAlthough, when we first entered it seemed as if we were the center of attraction but it quickly disappeared after about fifteen minutes. As the crowd started to trickle in slowly, the vibe shifted to a more relaxed and fun state. The atmosphere and the people were pretty cool. We met a lot of cool people which we truly enjoyed very much.\n\nThe backyard area is awesome with plenty of seating but make sure to get there early for a seat because it gets crowded quickly. On Tuesdays, it is called Taco Tuesdays. Thursday- Sunday, there are DJs that play awesome music. I will definitely be back real soon because we had so much fun."", ""You found the hidden treasure, Lina. We're glad to hear you were a fan of our vibes. We're always here when you're looking for quality food and drinks.\n\nBest,\nJames R., Owner"", 'Came in after an elite event nearby for a night cap or two ;)  Lively, mixed crowd, the way I like it.  Great, friendly service from beginning to end.  They have a basic, straight forward bar menu with anything you\'re craving.  Or simply need something to absorb your consumption of H2O; oh who am I kidding.  You know what I mean.\n\nWe indulged in their red sangria and it was ""da bomb"" (who even says that anymore, amiright?)  Got hungry, ordered the loaded fries which did not disappoint.

She had a ravioli & I had the branzino the food was really delicious the fish was cooked in their famous la tabun oven which is a special custom middle eastern oven I was really excited to see that before entering the restaurant will be deffenitly coming back here to try out all the other delicious things they have to offer', ""Perfect place for Breakfast, Brunch, and Dinner.\nThis specific image is from breakfast but I've been there for all 3! They have amazing service! The food is always so delicious. Exploding my taste buds each and every time I took a bite. And they know how to treat their customers! A+ service! Would go back over and over again!"", 'Great restaurant! Got the Haifa pizza, baked ziti and bronzino, and all were amazing! I will definitely be coming back here!', 'Went there today for breakfast service was extremely slow took forever To get the food, my wife\'s food took very long for an omelet, I finished my food by the time her food came. Her bread came frozen ice inside the omelet was cold as well it was sitting on the counter In front  of us but it seemed like they were waiting for the bread to defrost. But it didn\'t because it still came frozen solid the manager saw that it was ice and offered us a khajapuri instead which took a while also... her omelet was supposed to come with coffee and orange juice which they did not serve with it until I asked the waiter for it and he answered me "" oh you want the orange juice and coffee?""  By the time we got the orange juice and coffee we were ready to leave... the manager ""compensated"" us by giving us a blueberry muffin... however I honestly don\'t think we would return unless the reviews change to excellent service. Food has a lot of potential it could be really good. But it was cold and unenjoyable', ""Just had a lovely meal at the new kosher cafe, La Tabun. It's located where Cafe K used to be. We were pleasantly surprised as it really exceeded our expectations! The owner was so gracious and welcoming. He aimed to please and was more than willing to adjust our orders to suit our preferences. The food was presented in such a beautiful manner, with salad, fresh hot bread, pickles and dips. We ordered the Tabun omelette and the mushroom ricotta quiche which were both delicious. The food came with fresh squeezed juice and coffee. Eating at La Tabun was a very enjoyable experience, and I hope to go there again.""]","{'url': 'https://www.yelp.com/raq/D4yoqzZ7ycSXGL2xjwJeMg?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw#popup%3Araq', 'use_case_text': 'Message the Business'}","['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-tabun-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Was greeted in a friendly manner by the staff, and the wait time was pretty short. Great vibes and chill atmosphere.', ""What a find. I'm visiting and had places marked on Google maps.

This is our favorite Brooklyn sushi spot, was always busy at night, with fresh and delicious sushi, and friendly fast, service.', 'TLDR: Downtown Brooklyn sushi restaurant. Priced very fairly, delicious sushi and rolls. I live in Queens and I trek out here because I think it\'s worth it. Taro is that neighborhood sushi restaurant that everyone wishes they had. Parking is difficult but if you can find a spot or take the trip over here - your tummy will be happy. Sushi Special for 2, that\'s all you need to know.\n\nI\'ve been coming to Taro for a number of years and it is definitely at the top of my list for casual sushi. It\'s within walking distance to Barclays so if you\'re out here for an event, I highly recommend stopping by here. They do take reservations so it\'s a good idea to call ahead.\n\nThis is my ""go to"" for casual sushi for at least 5 years. They have a Sushi Special for 2 which clocks in at $50 approximately. You each get about 10 pieces of nigiri sushi (all dressed in various ways) and two large rolls to share. You probably don\'t need anything extra if you get this, it is filling. Also - if you\'d like less rice, they can accommodate that as well.\n\nThe prices are more than reasonable for the quality of fish that you\'re getting here. The special comes with the Mountain Roll and a Shrimp Tempura Roll. The mountain is basically a yellowtail/avocado and a spicy tuna roll in one.\n\nTill this day, this is my favorite shrimp tempura roll anywhere. It\'s fried just right, served slightly warm and it nothing like the dry sogginess encountered usually.', ""I've been here twice and I wish I lived here - cause I'd come here every damn week. Neighborhood sushi restaurant up the block from Barclays. The fish here is fresh and the small plates are great too.\n\nOn my last visit, my girlfriend and I shared the Sushi Deluxe for 2 which is $52 for a lot of food. We unnecessarily got two handrolls, a negitoro and california (real) crab. We also got two of the kumamoto oysters with ponzu. Had the ankimo or monk fish liver with ponzu previously, so good.\n\nLove this place every time. If you're in or live around here, you're lucky and take advantage!"", 'I came here for lunch around 1pm. I ordered the lunch special to go, which was your choice of meat/or meat substitute, salad, pumpkin, two dumplings, salad, soup, and your choice of a sushi roll.

Sushi Special for 2, that\'s all you need to know.\n\nI\'ve been coming to Taro for a number of years and it is definitely at the top of my list for casual sushi. It\'s within walking distance to Barclays so if you\'re out here for an event, I highly recommend stopping by here. They do take reservations so it\'s a good idea to call ahead.\n\nThis is my ""go to"" for casual sushi for at least 5 years. They have a Sushi Special for 2 which clocks in at $50 approximately. You each get about 10 pieces of nigiri sushi (all dressed in various ways) and two large rolls to share. You probably don\'t need anything extra if you get this, it is filling. Also - if you\'d like less rice, they can accommodate that as well.\n\nThe prices are more than reasonable for the quality of fish that you\'re getting here. The special comes with the Mountain Roll and a Shrimp Tempura Roll. The mountain is basically a yellowtail/avocado and a spicy tuna roll in one.\n\nTill this day, this is my favorite shrimp tempura roll anywhere. It\'s fried just right, served slightly warm and it nothing like the dry sogginess encountered usually.', ""I've been here twice and I wish I lived here - cause I'd come here every damn week. Neighborhood sushi restaurant up the block from Barclays. The fish here is fresh and the small plates are great too.\n\nOn my last visit, my girlfriend and I shared the Sushi Deluxe for 2 which is $52 for a lot of food. We unnecessarily got two handrolls, a negitoro and california (real) crab. We also got two of the kumamoto oysters with ponzu. Had the ankimo or monk fish liver with ponzu previously, so good.\n\nLove this place every time.

The soy glaze was sweet and tangy and the tofu was cooked to have enough crunch and moisture. I would seriously buy the sauce by the bottle.\nOn my next visit...(which may or may not be within the next few days) I will order the tofu and shiitake bowl- the entree portion that comes with rice or zucchini noodles.\n\nThe size of the restaurant is quite deceiving as it seems very small upon entering but it's actually pretty big.

They switched out the artichoke bun for a impossible burger bun. Missed the old, but love the new.\n\nMy teenage son loads up on the Korean fried chicken buns.

We arrived around 6pm on Friday and were seated right away. My friend swears by the Bulgogi bowl. He will tell anyone who will listen why he loves it but I'll let him write his own yelp review. I ordered the cauliflower nuggets and the fried organic tofu and shiitake bun.\n\nThe food arrived very quickly. I don't think we waited more than 5 minutes for the food. The cauliflower nuggets were ok. I wish the cauliflower had been cut into similar sizes to help with the distribution of the seasoning and batter. Some bites were flavorless crisps and others had a bit more seasoning and a much softer texture. I'm not sure that I would order this again.\n\nThe buns are small and more like an appetizer in my opinion. The fried organic tofu and shiitake bun was absolutely delicious. The soy glaze was sweet and tangy and the tofu was cooked to have enough crunch and moisture. I would seriously buy the sauce by the bottle.\nOn my next visit...(which may or may not be within the next few days) I will order the tofu and shiitake bowl- the entree portion that comes with rice or zucchini noodles.\n\nThe size of the restaurant is quite deceiving as it seems very small upon entering but it's actually pretty big. I wish I had taken pictures of the bar area and the back of the restaurant. There is a lot of  space towards the back and by the bar which I didn't notice until I went to the bathroom. The bar area had a few people eating by themselves and my friend stated that he often goes to bunsmith alone. If you are someone who struggles with finding places where you feel comfortable eating alone (I sometimes do) this is a great spot!\n\nThe music was a fun 2000s playlist. Everyone seated around me was throwing their hands up to the songs. All and all great food and a very fun vibe."", 'This is a great spot for steamed buns and Asian fusion in general. The pork jowl, Korean friend chicken and bulgogi beef are all exploding with flavor, but my favorite is probably the jowl.\n\nThe restaurant is trendy located right in the hub of crown heights on Franklin Avenue.\n\nBuns runs around $5/ea. Last I checked, they no longer had the happy hour deal during which they were even cheaper, but still worth it nonetheless.', ""Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. It was late night and they were playing great music (90s hip hop). The ambiance is great and the food was delicious. I would definitely go back when I'm in Brooklyn!"", ""One of my favorite restaurants! It's on a hip stretch of restaurants in Crown Heights. The place has a casual great vibe. The highlights are their buns, Korean fried chicken & various appetizers (like the shishito peppers & sticky fries). It's not particularly kid friendly but if your kids are pretty mature, well behaved and adventurous eaters, it's ok for them.\n\nSoju (Korean alcoholic rice drink) is tasty and similar to a not so strong Russian vodka but w/ rice instead of potatoes.\n\nFried tofu & shiitake buns are my favorite. They switched out the artichoke bun for a impossible burger bun. Missed the old, but love the new.\n\nMy teenage son loads up on the Korean fried chicken buns. You really can't go wrong if you like tasty yummy morsels that melt in your mouth. Bunsmith for the win!""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bunsmith-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

He had pastrami with some rye bread and had I potato pancakes.  ***pickles and coleslaw We were very satisfied with our food selection reminding us home cook Jewish meals we grew up with an amazing feeling.\n\nMy potato pancakes were delish light and crisp with great onion flavor blending perfectly with the potato. Yummyyyyyyyy !!!\n\nThe personal at the deli who were taking our order were nice.  We started reminiscing about Jewish foods we ate as kids such a positive energy and a special experience.', '11/18/19\n5 stars for the pastrami sandwich. Everything else is downhill from there. I also ordered the special which included a hotdog, knish, drink. The person behind the counter only put condiments on part of the hotdog. The knish was dried out and bland. He also told me that the pastrami sandwich came with mustard but he forgot to put the mustard on. I ordered a potato pancake which he forgot to place in the bag. I had to check through the bag before paying since he forgot to place half of the items inside. Potato pancake was quite tasty but very greasy. It might be better to dine in here or just stick to pastrami sandwhich and check everything before you leave the store', ""With the Corona Virus going around we are trying to help those that are open and serving. Had a huge overstuffed brisket that came with pickles and coleslaw. My treat was the sweet potatoe fries  with their secret dip. Very good. Not giving a 5 because I didn't get an itemized bill and the fries didn't come hot. (-\nIf you order for delivery there's a $2 charge and we gave a tip.\n25% off for #coronatimes\nSupport your local community.\nThis was my 1st time and now it won't be my last."", ""The food at this deli is spectacular. I came here with 23 other people on Saturday 11/16 for a special event and every person left saying this was the best deli they've ever had in their life.\n\nThe brisket and the pastrami melt in your mouth.  The potato latkes are fresh and delicious. Try the applesauce and the Russian dressing too. Both condiments are made in house abd it is obvious they are made with love.\n\nAs good as the food is, the  best part of this restaurant  is not the food,  it is the owners.  Jay and Lloyd absolutely love what they do and they provide wonderful customer service from the moment you walk into the place.\n\nNo matter where you are from go to this restaurant for the best deli in the five boroughs.\n\nI promise you will not be disappointed."", ""Like stepping back in time. A little outdated according to today's standards with regard to hygiene with mustard on the table with a plastic spoon and plastic coffee cup top cover. Not sure how hygienic it was. I mean who knows who sneezed in there. Service is excellent, and the staff are freindly. Its clean, and you get promptly assistance. I got the pastrami sandwich on wholewheat bread, and the pastrami was thin cut. I get that they make it themselves and they have their own factory. It just felt like a sandwich I can make at home. Their calslaw was to die for, and their pickles were good. They claim to be Kosher but they are open on Suabbat, so that's very confusing. If you're  the mood for old school spot while in the area, then stop in. But, if you're making a trip, then perhaps Katz's would be better."", 'Corporate meeting went excellent with pastrami sandwiches from Lloyd. It was delicious, big and juicy.

I was really excited to arrive, especially since I haven't visited in so long. I had a really friendly bartender that handed me a menu and pointed out the happy hour food menu. I inquired about happy hour for drinks and was informed happy hour drinks were not available. That was such a big bummer but decided not to give up.\n\nI should have given up, I ordered several happy hour food selections and a few drinks. I was kindly informed about a new chef running the kitchen and how he reinvented the menus. Sigh just sigh. The devil eggs I ordered was a single boiled egg cut in half with unnecessary toppings that added zero flavor or substance to the devil egg. Actually felt that I would have preferred the egg naked. The lobster bisque over fries was flavorless. I barely tasted lobster and the fries were soggy. I had the happy hour oysters, I am not sure what the name of it was but they were small. They were fresh but I feel I ordered them to try to redeem this place even though I knew I would never be coming back.\n\nMy drinks were decent but for $15 a drink and lackluster food I wasn't impressed. 2 stars for the friendly staff.\n\nThis place is probably still very nice last stop to end a long night but definitely not worth a after work place."", ""I like that they have happy hour after 11 for night owls. So if u are in the area and trying to get a few extra drinks in before u turn in then this place is pretty chill.\n    Bar seating experience is all I can attest for. Food comes out fast and bartenders are super nice, witty, and knowledgable. Bartenders will also acknowledge you as you walk in. They will also recommend selections that suit your preferences from the menu. I really enjoyed their hot cider. It definitely fights the chill and relaxes one.\n    Food here can be so so flavorwise for me. I only truly enjoyed the brussel sprouts and side fries with the sauces. I would order those two things on all our visits. My companion loves the food here and is a major fan. We have been here 4 times and each time the place becomes more comfortable. I don't find their menu extensive but they make enough choices for most people."", ""I'm giving this place 5 stars because I came in to grab a quick drink to steady my neves before attending an event where I won't know anyone.\n\nRight away, I felt instantly comfortable as a solo female in this old school bar. The bar is S shaped and more conducive to socializing and they were playing old school 70s rock which made this old head feel welcome! I explained to the bartender why I was there (had a few minutes to kill before the event) and what I was trying to accomplish (relax my usual I Hate People wall) and he recommend a shot of tequila, which was perfect! The menu is really cute with a variety of American fare that includes vegetarian options  of soups, salads,  sandwiches, small plates and weekly specials.\n\nI like it here. You won't be disappointed if you come!"", ""My friend and his fiancé are ditching New York for Australia, and this place is where he chooses to say his goodbyes to us. The lovely couple used to live around the corner and this was one of their local favorites.\n\nWhen you walk into the restaurant there is indoor seating for dining, and then there is sorta this outdoor patio bar area if you go through a door on the left side. That's what I am reviewing for now.\n\nThis area has bar seating with TVs and then bunch of benches and tables. There are a variety of drinks you can order at the bar along with a some delicious bar food. The vibe is wonderful. Bartender is super helpful and just a chill place to hang.\n\nI hesitant to order anything since was recovering from a stomach bug at the time, and ended up asking the bartender suggestions. I asked if he had any hot drinks and he suggested the Hot Cider ( hot apple cider and whiskey) and it was delicious!! I ended up ordering 2 that night.\n\nFor food, my friends had strong opinions on the chicken and regular burger. He preferred the chicken burger, and she preferred the regular burger. When I ordered the chicken burger, the bartender looked at me and suggested it wasn't a good idea with my stomach situation. I ended up offing my friend's wife's suggestion, a regular burger, and I'm glad I did. It was a solid burger and definitely simple and exactly what I want when I order a burger. It satisfies your burger needs without feeling the guilt of eating one!\n\nOverall I had a great time and enjoyed everything I ordered ( my stomach still hates me though), and if I lived around the area I would definitely come by for drinks and hanging out. But will def be back to try the chicken burger!"", 'I rarely write reviews, but in this case had to speak up and share my experience for being charged $30 for one frozen cocktail. Long story short I stopped through to try and catch an old friend who worked there, but turns out has since left. When paying my tab, the transaction goes through for $30 for a frozen guava drink which we shared, but we decided to move on.\n\nI confront the bartender at a busy bar and he treats me like I am inconveniencing him. He processes a ""refund"" and I sign off on the correct amount. There is a temporary refund in my account, but when all posts to my bank, low and behold, I was taken for a $30 frozen drink.\n\nNever again will I step into this establishment and further evidence that Williamsburg is a shit place to spend your time and money. Not the first time this summer dealing with people who try and up-charge on the fly, but I consider this lack of service and failure to correct the issue more or less a scam.']",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/extra-fancy-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

This cash only place only has 4-5 tables or so with limited bar seating but it\'s worth the wait.\n\nTheir buffalo chicken salad is great. Chicken is well flavored and with the perfect amount of ""buffalo"" zest and crunch. Big fan of their fried pickles as well and the mayo it comes with is such a good dipping sauce. I thought the servicing sizes were pretty solid but the juevos rancheros still left me a little hungry.\n\nTLDR: Go and try everything, it\'s really good and worth any wait.', ""I really love eating here. The food has been consistently good no matter what I've gotten or when I have came, the Kale melt is my absolute favorite, I strongly recommend it, cheesy goodness. The menu is large enough to accommodate just about anyone, sandwiches, entrees, breakfast and brunch... The interior has a no frills but cozy vibe, it's not very large and seating might be limited at busy times but I'll wait and I'll keep coming back. They serve booze and incredible floats, which you can add booze to (girlscout cookies with whiskey?! Yes please!). This spot is a staple in Williamsburg just down the block from the park, do yourself a favor and drop in."", ""Big fan of Jimmy's. It's been a delightful two visits there. First time was for the chicken club with fries. Sammie was nice and crispy with fries. Jimmy's take the time to package your food well and once your at the office or home it's just a fresh. The Mac and cheese is pretty legit. Nice and creamy with some burnt cheddar.\nSecond visit I had the Buffalo Strip Salad. Yummy chicken finger in a house made hot buffalo sauce over mixed greens with pico de Gallo ( could of used a little more of this). Topped it off with a peanut butter shake.\nLike I mentioned earlier I'm a big fan of Jimmy's. Loads of menu options to try next. More BK greatness.\n\nSee more content here !\n\ninstagram.com/marcoskick…"", ""Diners, dives and dumps....\nWe went off the recommendation of Guy Fieri's show. Of course it has beens years since he went and things change over time so our experience was a little different. It is a great place for those that live in walking distance because it is conveniently nestled in the neighborhood. Very small so a party of two is perfect, a party of four is doable but anything more is very tight. The food is typical diner food nothing special that you have to have right now or would run back to try immediately. The chicken and waffles were good. The chicken was seasoned right but a litlle over cooked."", ""A good and homey spot in an otherwise rather sterile-looking section of Williamsburg. I had sausage gravy and eggs (tasty, though the gravy was a bit too gloppy) and tried the regular, which was more or less standard. My favorite thing was actually the latkes - they were incredible. I had been craving latkes all week and didn't know they had them on the menu, so it was a nice surprise.\n\nI also had a few sips of my cousin's Mustang milkshake (vanilla maple bourbon) and it was super strong and delicious. Great service, too.\n\nNext time: need to try the chicken and waffles!"", ""Drove around trying to figure out where to eat. Remembered that Guy Fieri visited on DD and D. We decided to drop in and try it out. I had the fish po'boy and he had the grits and eggs breakfast bowl. What can we say! The sandwich was fresh and delicious and the sweet potato fries were to die for! The grits were smooth and creamy with a healthy portion of eggs. We will definitely eat here again!"", ""Holy cow.

They continue to make silly avoidable mistakes.\n\nFor example, I ordered three items on this last visit. Wings, fries and calamari.\nI was served some wings and fries in a timely manner. When I asked about my calamari a different server than the one who took my order said he'll check on it.\nStrange, calamari doesn't take that long to prepare.

I guess they mostly cater to the neighborhood locals.\n\nThe second clue should have been at 5:30 p.m. , my friend and I were the only patrons in the restaurant, besides a group of guys at the bar having beers.  I dont know why took over 40 minutes for our order to come.\n\nI ordered the chopped smoke chicken which was delicious.  My sides were the baked beans and mac and cheese.  The baked beans was nothing spectacular.  They probably opened a can of beans and not add any additional seasoning.  The mac and cheese look and tasted like canned liquid cheese was used.\n\nI cannot understand how people go to the expense to open a business and not put TLC into the food.\n\nAnyway, that was my last visit to this restaurant.', 'This is my 2nd time grabbing something to eat and meet up with friends here.

This was my second time at Mullanes, the first time being late last year with friends visiting from the West Coast. Perfect place for a nightcap, and it didn't fail this time either.\n\nAesthetics/Ambiance: Low lit, sports-bar style, music can be a bit loud hence the half star demotion. The space is quite large though, with space in the back away from the bar for a little more privacy which is where my boys and I were.\n\nService: Yuliet was her name I believe. She was sweet and capable. No real complaints. Just a heads up that it you do decide to sit in the back, ordering may be a bit more of a task. Food came relatively quickly though, so that makes up for that.\n\nFood and Drink: I had a Dark and Stormy that I ordered prior to my boys arriving, which is my other half star demotion, leading to a solid 4. It's not that it was bad, I've just had a lot better. So blame my rapidly maturing palate.\nI had an order of mozzarella sticks: cheesy, well fried. Contentment. D had the Trio: rolled chicken tacos, cheese sticks, and buffalo chicken; as well an order of nachos. Jay had the veggie burger, being vegan and all. I don't know how I got roped into being friends with a vegan, but there you have it. They both enjoyed their meals so that makes for a happy MarieM.\n\nAs always-- happy eating and drinking. MarieMG"", ""They have the basics- but compare to the few pub spots I've been to, Mullanes kind of steps it up a notch with some of their bar food.  \n\nEven from a block away, you could see Mullanes' red frame. Spacious layout, sizable Bar hooked up with high tables/stools, Dining area in the back with Brick walls here and there. There were a couple of decent menu items, but kept it low key for a late night.\n\nSeasony Mozzarella Sticks had a crunchy outside and gooey inside. My 'Green Tea' Cocktail tasted good, had some strength with Whiskey, Iced Tea and Peach Schnapps- but was overwhelmed with ice.\n\nReally liked my Salmon Burger and went with just lettuce, tomato and raw onions. Originally, my Salmon Burger came with a House or Caesar Salad side- but opted out of those and eyed the Cinnamon dusted, Sweet Potato Fries- instead. Our server Julie, substituted that quick- at no charge. Thank you! Oh... and the Cinnamon-Mango Chutney for my Fries? Ruled that night!!!\n\nMy husband went for a Bleu Cheese burger and said was good. Quick midnight meal here was good and can't complain about much.

The staff and other guests recommended Mullanes and I was pretty please by the atmosphere and staff. I didn't eat much due to recently getting over being sick, so I just ordered fries, water, and a Jack and ginger.\n\nIt was the perfect spot for Sunday night football and could definitely see myself there again. Not to mention, it's next door to my favorite spot -- Spike Lee's 40 Acres & a Mule Productions. Lol From the people around us, the $16 bottomless mimosas aren't a bad deal either so will have to return to try those out for myself."", ""My first few times at Mullanes Bar & Grill was in 2014. I rated them two stars back then. I'm sad to say in 2019 not much has changed. Well it has but not for the better.\n\nLong story (tryna be short), it's a nice enough spot location wise (street parking is hit or miss though) and with ambience, even with friendly staff they still seem a bit confused. They continue to make silly avoidable mistakes.\n\nFor example, I ordered three items on this last visit. Wings, fries and calamari.\nI was served some wings and fries in a timely manner. When I asked about my calamari a different server than the one who took my order said he'll check on it.\nStrange, calamari doesn't take that long to prepare. He came back saying the order wasn't placed. Wait what?!? I had an indepth conversation with the lady because I wanted the regular marinara sauce changed to blue cheese (don't judge me) and she absolutely assured me this would not be a problem then walked into the kitchen and forgot my order? Strange.\n\nIt just went downhill from there. It's as though you're at the home of one of your scattered brain friends instead of a paying customer in an establishment.\n\nTheir Lynchburg tasted of sour lemons/limes but they were gracious enough to change it for a straight from the bottle (no chaser no ice) drink.\n\nI stress, nice (new to me) staff but just not professional at all.\n\nThe End."", 'Whaaaat! No frozen magaritaville because the season changed! What type of place/country is this?!?\n\nForced to go with margarita wait for it....on the rocks *le sighs*. It didnt taste that spectacular. No matter how hard I stirred, the flavors just weren\'t cooperating, they stayed apart. (Yes I was the crazy \'fro lady stirring at the bar)\n\nThere are about 7 regular, 1large screen tellys in here, the music is loud and we\'re trying to be heard. There\'s an energy in Mullanes that you won\'t appreciate if you\'re looking for a quite evening in Magaritaville.\n\nThe 2 crab cakes which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli were flavour-less. The MickeyDees ""fish"" burger was more appetizing.\n\nThe Chaos Pie: A layer of brownie, cheesecake, fudge cake, walnuts and topped with chocolate mousse, truffles decorated with walnuts and white chocolate hit the spot.\n\nThe End', ""I must admit that I made a tremendous error when I posted the previous review as the food nor the review should have been for Mullanes Bar & Grill.\n\nI came to this bar with a friend for a bite to eat and drinks... wonderful people, wonderful drinks, good food and energetic atmosphere.\n\nI had a burger and my friend had wings.  She's a regular here and their wings are her favorite.  I must admit, I really enjoy the burger and the wings .  Service was on point and there is a television at the bar.  I have been back her twice since and definitely intend to patronize Mullanes again."", 'I was very disappointed with my visit to this restaurant.  First off, parking is horrendous.  I guess they mostly cater to the neighborhood locals.\n\nThe second clue should have been at 5:30 p.m. , my friend and I were the only patrons in the restaurant, besides a group of guys at the bar having beers.  I dont know why took over 40 minutes for our order to come.\n\nI ordered the chopped smoke chicken which was delicious.  My sides were the baked beans and mac and cheese.  The baked beans was nothing spectacular.  They probably opened a can of beans and not add any additional seasoning.  The mac and cheese look and tasted like canned liquid cheese was used.\n\nI cannot understand how people go to the expense to open a business and not put TLC into the food.\n\nAnyway, that was my last visit to this restaurant.', 'This is my 2nd time grabbing something to eat and meet up with friends here. And let me tell you the chicken wings are delicious. Bartender took our order because we ended up going around lunch.\n\nThe host was really sweet and gave us the option to decide where we wanted to sit', ""I'm a sucker for bars-- especially those that are dimly lit and lend to conversations. This was my second time at Mullanes, the first time being late last year with friends visiting from the West Coast. Perfect place for a nightcap, and it didn't fail this time either.\n\nAesthetics/Ambiance: Low lit, sports-bar style, music can be a bit loud hence the half star demotion. The space is quite large though, with space in the back away from the bar for a little more privacy which is where my boys and I were.\n\nService: Yuliet was her name I believe. She was sweet and capable. No real complaints. Just a heads up that it you do decide to sit in the back, ordering may be a bit more of a task. Food came relatively quickly though, so that makes up for that.\n\nFood and Drink: I had a Dark and Stormy that I ordered prior to my boys arriving, which is my other half star demotion, leading to a solid 4. It's not that it was bad, I've just had a lot better. So blame my rapidly maturing palate.\nI had an order of mozzarella sticks: cheesy, well fried. Contentment. D had the Trio: rolled chicken tacos, cheese sticks, and buffalo chicken; as well an order of nachos. Jay had the veggie burger, being vegan and all. I don't know how I got roped into being friends with a vegan, but there you have it. They both enjoyed their meals so that makes for a happy MarieM.\n\nAs always-- happy eating and drinking. MarieMG"", ""They have the basics- but compare to the few pub spots I've been to, Mullanes kind of steps it up a notch with some of their bar food.  \n\nEven from a block away, you could see Mullanes' red frame. Spacious layout, sizable Bar hooked up with high tables/stools, Dining area in the back with Brick walls here and there. There were a couple of decent menu items, but kept it low key for a late night.\n\nSeasony Mozzarella Sticks had a crunchy outside and gooey inside. My 'Green Tea' Cocktail tasted good, had some strength with Whiskey, Iced Tea and Peach Schnapps- but was overwhelmed with ice.\n\nReally liked my Salmon Burger and went with just lettuce, tomato and raw onions. Originally, my Salmon Burger came with a House or Caesar Salad side- but opted out of those and eyed the Cinnamon dusted, Sweet Potato Fries- instead. Our server Julie, substituted that quick- at no charge. Thank you! Oh... and the Cinnamon-Mango Chutney for my Fries? Ruled that night!!!\n\nMy husband went for a Bleu Cheese burger and said was good. Quick midnight meal here was good and can't complain about much. But I get it, you're not coming here for a gastronomic experience. Our server was pleasant, all smiles and accommodating to my ways- definitely a 5 Star for her.

We arrived and were told our table isn\'t ready yet as the couple before us is about to leave. We waited by the door for 5 minutes until the hostess moved us closer to the bar and we waited for another 15 minutes. It took about 15 minutes for someone to come and ask us if we\'d like a drink. We ordered and by the time the drink was ready we finally were seated a total of 20 minutes late. They were busy at that time and seemed almost frantic that said, annoyance was my first impression. Once sat our drinks came about 5 minutes later.\n\nCarrot Spirit with Cocchi Americano, Finocchietto & lemon - light citrusy delicious - 9 of 10\n\nBourbon with Apple, Averna & Sassafras Bitters - Excellent fall drink that warmed me up. A little manhattan\'esque but with flavors of fall - 9 of 10\n\nBread & Housemade Butter with Raw Honey & Radishes - Delightful combination of salty creamy butter combined with the spice and tang of the radish and the sweetness of honey was a mixture of flavors that blended together and was the perfect start to the dinner - 8 of 10\n\nSpanish Mackerel Crudo with Matsutake Mushrooms, Apple & Corn - Was concerned at first the Mackerel would be too oily and ""fishy"" but it turned out to be well balanced with the sweetness of the Apple and corn. Definitely a welcomed surprise - 8 of 10\n\nRoasted Pork Belly with Creme Fraiche, Caraflex Cabbage & trout roe - Pork belly was well cooked. Crispy on top and mixed with the creme fraiche which added a creaminess to the crunch of salt from the pork and the trout roe. Another great dish - 9 of 10\n\nSwiss Chard Lasagna with Pine Nuts, Parmesan & olives - My wife had this dish and I took a taste. Definitely dense with the flavor of Swiss chard and pine nuts. My wife seemed to like it but wasn\'t wowed. I didn\'t think it was that bad but wasn\'t my kind of dish - 7 of 10\n\nPappardelle with Peekytoe Crab, Littleneck Clams, Aji Dulce Peppers & Saffron - A solid pasta dish with homemade pasta and a rich creamy saffron sauce. Clams cooked with the sauce and crab shredded on top. Was a satisfying pasta dish. Asked for a side of bread to finish the remaining sauce and they gave some free of charge - 8 of 10\n\nChocolate Cake with Pine Nuts & Rosemary - Delicious. Chocolate cake was a dense cake and the pine nuts added a nice bit of crunch to the dish. The top of the cake had a layer of thick gooey caramel that was delicious. Crumble texture of cake mixed with gooeyness of caramel and crunch of pine nuts was fantastic - 9 of 10\n\nBay Leaf Panna Cotta with Pistachio and Pluots - Creamy Panna Cotta with faint flavor of Bay leaf and Pistachio. I did not notice the Pluots but it was covered with a mix of granola and pomegranate that gave a nice sweetness and crunchiness to the cream of the Panna Cotta - 9 of 10\n\nOverall a good solid experience. I find the food to be of better quality and creativity than nearby area restaurants but at a price. Service could have been improved with honoring reservation times and offering drinks up front instead of making us wait around on slow initial service. Service was a little slow overall even as business began to die down. Friendly but slow. I\'d come back here again on the occasion. Of the Michelin rated stars I\'ve experienced, I think it warrants it but I\'ve also had better at other 1 star restaurants and it would really need to step it up for 2-3 stars in terms of service and food.', ""This is a wonderful restaurant with a view of the beautiful open kitchen where you can watch the chefs hard at work. The servers are friendly and helpful with any questions you have about the menu.\n\nI wasn't entirely impressed with their wine selection but liked that the menu wasn't large - just a few appetizers, entrees and desserts.\n\nWe started off with the bread and radishes. I would never imagine that pair together but it worked very well, especially with the paired honey. A simple dish that's inventive.

It's a very clean dish and since it's peak summer, there is no reason to skip over heirloom tomatoes.\n\nFor our mains, we had the einkorn and squid ink pasta.

My mom was always insisting while I was growing up.\n\nI wasn\'t a big fan of greens in general, nor the fact that she considered them mine. Those boiled brussels sprouts, tasteless salad lettuces, and limp bok choy...those are your greens.\n\nWell, The Finch\'s Swiss Chard Lasagna...these are my greens.\n\nThe chef here has layered spinach, chard, and arugula with pine nuts, rye and semolina pasta, parmesan, and some sort of impossibly delicious olive pesto, and created that rare dish that is packed with the things you should be eating, and also tastes so damn delicious. If you have to eat your greens, I honestly don\'t think you can do any better than this.\n\nThankfully, the quality extends to the rest of the menu, and really, the rest of the restaurant as well. The space is beautifully clean, with marble counters, a kitchen more open than most, and a surprisingly large space. The staff is lovely, with a bartender who is extremely knowledgable about wine, and also happens to make an excellent old fashioned.\n\nWhether you\'re sitting at the bar, or in either the front or back dining rooms, you\'re in for a treat.\n\nWe shared the silkiest chicken liver mousse you could ask for to start. With Bien Cuit toast (I think I overheard that said, and I love my local bakery), and the surprisingly large portion left me wanting for nothing but some more pickled vegetables to balance out the richness. The maitake mushroom toast was a similarly wonderful balance of flavors. The smoked and smooth ricotta and the peppery arugula were a wonderful foil for the chew on the mushrooms.\n\nI went with the branzino as a main, and I was duly impressed by the perfect cross-hatch scoring of the crisp skin, and the freshness of the fish as well. The pickled cauliflower underneath was the same as that on the side of the mousse, and I wasn\'t complaining. My only complaint was that I ate everything, including at least half her swiss chard lasagna, and couldn\'t order dessert.\n\nAlso, I like that their menu and checkholder both told me I look nice. I did look nice. Thanks for noticing.\n\nI will absolutely be back.', 'This is hands down the worst meal I have had in New York.\nThe Finch is a neighborhood restaurant in Clinton Hill, with very few other options nearby.

The place was cozy, relaxing, with an open kitchen, not yet dominated by millenials (thank god, but jk).\n\nFood:\nBread, butter, raw honey, radishes - never had the bread-butter-radish combo with raw honey before. The honey was funky in a good way, but the proportion of this starter was laughable - piles of radishes with only five tiny slices of unimpressive bread. We ended up using the radish slices to scoop up the honey and butter (we did not want to waste food; plus, it was $10). The radish was crispy, earthy, with nice watery texture, but our hands got sticky, concluding that we never had so many radishes in one setting and felt like rabbits.\n\nLettuce with avocado squash - note that those delicious slices of avocado squash were buried in the bottom of a pile of lettuce, but if you dig them out and blend with lettuce (and even more radish!) and buttermilk dressing, this salad was divine, creamy, but still made you feel...somewhat healthy.\n\nChicken with corn, tomato & chanterelles - a umami bomb. The chicken was charred outside, tender and juicy inside. My bf bet that the meat was sous vide first and then roasted/charred. I did not enter the bet. Tomatoes were extremely juicy, but salt seemed to have overpowered the lovely flavor of chanterelles. Generally delicious, even tho my fav mushroom was not treated properly.\n\nTrout with early fall squash and nuts was arguably more mild and pleasant - seem to resemble a golden harvest of the fall (after having too many radishes, my peasant-roots surfaced). The trout was tender, rather unsalted, but the crunchiness of seeds and nuts added nice texture and complexity to the fish.\n\nSaffron panna cotta - not my fav. The raspberries were not fresh, and the saffron flavor tasted more like unfiltered tap water, with faint smell of chlorine, strangely.\n\nDrinks:\nBourbon based cocktail - strong and delicious, very curious with a lingering taste of pine nuts.\nSlovenian red wine - never had red wine from Slovenia before, very velvety, smoked peppercorn taste, interesting.\n$10 Tokaji - who needs dessert if you can get this golden liquid for $10? This one did not have the complexity as those with higher puttonyos, but still tasted like honey/honeysuckle/white flowers. Sweet but never overwhelming.', ""Had dinner last night and glad that everything is still as good or better than my previous experience.

The beets and burrata ($20) was just ok and the quality was not worth the price. The burrata was hard and didn't have the creaminess that I expected.\n\nThe squid ink tagliatelle ($28) had shrimp that were tiny and the quality was pretty terrible.

We arrived and were told our table isn\'t ready yet as the couple before us is about to leave. We waited by the door for 5 minutes until the hostess moved us closer to the bar and we waited for another 15 minutes. It took about 15 minutes for someone to come and ask us if we\'d like a drink. We ordered and by the time the drink was ready we finally were seated a total of 20 minutes late. They were busy at that time and seemed almost frantic that said, annoyance was my first impression. Once sat our drinks came about 5 minutes later.\n\nCarrot Spirit with Cocchi Americano, Finocchietto & lemon - light citrusy delicious - 9 of 10\n\nBourbon with Apple, Averna & Sassafras Bitters - Excellent fall drink that warmed me up. A little manhattan\'esque but with flavors of fall - 9 of 10\n\nBread & Housemade Butter with Raw Honey & Radishes - Delightful combination of salty creamy butter combined with the spice and tang of the radish and the sweetness of honey was a mixture of flavors that blended together and was the perfect start to the dinner - 8 of 10\n\nSpanish Mackerel Crudo with Matsutake Mushrooms, Apple & Corn - Was concerned at first the Mackerel would be too oily and ""fishy"" but it turned out to be well balanced with the sweetness of the Apple and corn. Definitely a welcomed surprise - 8 of 10\n\nRoasted Pork Belly with Creme Fraiche, Caraflex Cabbage & trout roe - Pork belly was well cooked. Crispy on top and mixed with the creme fraiche which added a creaminess to the crunch of salt from the pork and the trout roe. Another great dish - 9 of 10\n\nSwiss Chard Lasagna with Pine Nuts, Parmesan & olives - My wife had this dish and I took a taste. Definitely dense with the flavor of Swiss chard and pine nuts. My wife seemed to like it but wasn\'t wowed. I didn\'t think it was that bad but wasn\'t my kind of dish - 7 of 10\n\nPappardelle with Peekytoe Crab, Littleneck Clams, Aji Dulce Peppers & Saffron - A solid pasta dish with homemade pasta and a rich creamy saffron sauce. Clams cooked with the sauce and crab shredded on top. Was a satisfying pasta dish. Asked for a side of bread to finish the remaining sauce and they gave some free of charge - 8 of 10\n\nChocolate Cake with Pine Nuts & Rosemary - Delicious. Chocolate cake was a dense cake and the pine nuts added a nice bit of crunch to the dish. The top of the cake had a layer of thick gooey caramel that was delicious. Crumble texture of cake mixed with gooeyness of caramel and crunch of pine nuts was fantastic - 9 of 10\n\nBay Leaf Panna Cotta with Pistachio and Pluots - Creamy Panna Cotta with faint flavor of Bay leaf and Pistachio. I did not notice the Pluots but it was covered with a mix of granola and pomegranate that gave a nice sweetness and crunchiness to the cream of the Panna Cotta - 9 of 10\n\nOverall a good solid experience. I find the food to be of better quality and creativity than nearby area restaurants but at a price. Service could have been improved with honoring reservation times and offering drinks up front instead of making us wait around on slow initial service. Service was a little slow overall even as business began to die down. Friendly but slow. I\'d come back here again on the occasion. Of the Michelin rated stars I\'ve experienced, I think it warrants it but I\'ve also had better at other 1 star restaurants and it would really need to step it up for 2-3 stars in terms of service and food.', ""This is a wonderful restaurant with a view of the beautiful open kitchen where you can watch the chefs hard at work.

Ample space for the stage and folks jamming along, and a Dr. Who bathroom (a first). The location is in a good spot, with lots of other bar options in the neighborhood.', ""This place has been around for 9 years before the mass gentrification occurred and it's great.  It's got an Awesome DR WHO/steampunk feel with a TARDIS bathroom (totally didn't realize that until much later in the night ).  They have trivia, karaoke, and live music, plus video games, board games, and great specials and drink prices.  The sound guy Anders, sometimes bartends on Thursdays, and is really funny! He even helped to build out the building when it first started.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Also, I guess Anders is the owner too."", 'My go to bar in the neighborhood, the Way Station has friendly service, good drinks and killer karaoke. Very good positive vibes from the staff and regulars alike.', ""Encourages folks to come out the last night before closures due to pandemic outbreak. Sorry. One extra night won't help the financial strain, which everyone is feeling. Practice some adulting please."", ""One of my favorite neighborhood dive bars. It has a Dr. Who theme and has live music most nights. This place has great happy hour specials every day. After happy hour, prices go up to normal as expected but during happy hour it is a great deal. There is a section for the bar area and then the stage area is a separate room so could provide more intimate setting for music lovers. Nothing fancy for cocktails or anything but a great, local place for beer and basic drinks. We love coming here early in the evening or late afternoon for pregame for the night to take advantage of the happy hour specials. Then it's a great place for the end of the night due to the live music. I don't watch Dr. Who but for all my friends who do, they loved the Dr. Who touches inside!"", ""Me the whole time I was here: youtube.com/watch?v=IRsP…\n\nI'm not a Doctor Who fan (blasphemy, I know).\n\nBut I like bars with cool bartenders, decent beers, and gimmicky bathrooms.\n\nOkay, maybe I can do without that last one.\n\nCould also do without bad singer songwriters who are pumped through the PA system a little too loudly.\n\nI feel like I'll be back though."", 'I\'ll be honest with you: I don\'t care about Doctor Who.\n\n(Maybe I would if I\'d ever actually seen an episode, but I\'m already pretty backed up in terms of TV I ""should"" be watching. And I\'m a busy man.*)\n\nLuckily, The Way Station has a number of things I do care about:\n\nHospitable service.\nExcellent entertainment (awesome live music, stellar burlesque, etc.).\nSolid cocktails and a good selection of beer.\nInteresting decor.\nA TARDIS.**\n\nYou know, the things you want in bars.\n\nBasically, the Way Station has been around for five years (congrats Andy!), and here\'s hoping they are around for at least five more.\n_____________\n\n*Later today I\'m going to have to figure out what to have for lunch, among other things.\n**It\'s cool. I don\'t think it\'s quite as cool as my international friends, who really, REALLY care about Doctor Who, but it\'s still cool.', ""The decor of this place is so interesting and fun! They have odd items on their walls and behind the bar. They also have a fun bathroom that looks like an old police station. The beers on tap here were all $8. I had the UFO Winter Ale and it was great! There was a live band playing and it was too loud for us to enjoy it so we ended up leaving after our first drink. There also isn't a ton of seating at this bar since its more of a music venue where people stand and watch the band. This is a cool spot to spot by on the weekend! After reading other Yelp reviews, it sounds like they have a great happy hour so I would be open to coming back and tryin their happy hour.""]",,[],https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-way-station-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

First off, the cider tap was so much fun (quite an experience) where you stand far away from the barrel and taste it fresh. The cider flight was also delicious and definitely more tart then any cider I've had previously. For brunch, I got the chicken and waffles which included perfectly fried dark meat and fluffy waffles.\nThe outside space was also so much fun. Go for the cider and food, stay for the corn hole!"", ""Came here with a few friends for a drink and a bite to eat.

When going to a cider house in the Basque country, it's not just about the cider or the meal - it's also the experience and sharing it with a group of people. This place I believe is the second Basque cider house to open in the US.\n\nOnto the drank. The cider was delicious. FYI, Basque ciders are dry ciders that taste like the cask. Don't expect that sweet sugary stuff you get when you have an angry orchard. Also, to get your cider, you must get up and collect it yourself - straight from the casks!\n\nWe ordered the prix fixe menu which was extremely similar to what you would get in Spain. All was delicious and they do have a vegetarian option if you need one. However, I believe if you go that route, the whole table would have to get the vegetarian option as it's family sharing style. Meat fans will not want to make that sacrifice when their steak is a mouthwatering ribeye.\n\nOne difference I found from the Basque country is that here you can only go get cider 3 times in between courses. In Spain, this is unlimited and you simply get up and refill your glass whenever you want. However, I feel like this is for a reason and us New Yorkers wouldn't be able to control ourselves and it would be a madhouse. So 3 times is plenty and you do have the option of ordering more bottles to the table."", ""So sloooooooooooow.\n\nThe food was really good though. We split a whole roasted chicken and it was delicious (and only $26!).\n\nThe chicken is served with vegetables and it's really flavorful.\n\nBut yes the service is incredibly slow and don't expect to get your food in less than 20 minutes at least."", ""Came here with a page out of the Brooklyn Pub Pass book.\n\nWe walked in around 8ish last night. The place was a little emptier than a usual Friday night in Bushwick, probably due to the weather. We were seated almost right away.\n\nBrooklyn Cider House is a warehouse turned cidery/small restaurant that has delicious draft ciders and beers (and literal drafts, we felt cold!) with plenty of seating on the inside and out. Its walls are decorated with murals and its bar is well-lit to show off the gazillions of ciders they have to offer.\n\nTheir drink menu was obviously extensive but apparently not up to date. All the beer drafts listed on the menu were out. I went with one of the waiter's recommendation and had a Paradox Pilsner to start. It was smooth, sweet, and light, and seemed like a good pairing with the food I was about to order.\n\nI started with the Korean Wings as my appetizer. The wings came out hot, and were incredibly crispy, but a bit on the dry side. I was hoping for a little more soy ginger garlic sauce. Nonetheless they were still good.\n\nFor my entree I got the Applewood Bacon Cheese Burger. The burger came out juicy and delicious, and paired very well with my Pilsner. My friends enjoyed the chicken tacos that they ordered. The food did take a little on the longer side to come out but it was good.\n\nMy dessert beer was the Kim Red Raspberry Sour Lagrrr from Singlecut brewery. I'm not the biggest fan of sour beers, but this one wasn't too bad! I think the aftertaste of sugar is what made it a lot more drinkable. I would definitely have it again.\n\nI would come back if I'm in the area."", 'My family and I went to Brooklyn Cider House for weekend brunch and it was a great experience. Beyond the food, I highly recommend partaking in the cider catching, which is normally included in the prix-fixe dinner. Not only do you get to try the ciders straight from the barrels, but you also get to hear about the history of the restaurant/cider house and the Basque/European style of cider.\n\nThe different ciders are delicious. Depending on which ones you get, the flavours can range from sweet to sour. We ordered a flight to try different varieties.\n\nThe food is delicious, too. Many of the dishes rely on the natural flavours of the ingredients, not incorporating heavy or thick sauces. For me, the highlights were the cowboy ribeye steak and the tortilla de bacalao. The cowboy ribeye steak is thick and juicy; it was delicious. The tortilla de bacalao was light, and the sweetness from the caramelised onions and peppers complemented the cod. For dessert, the cider doughnuts were a sweet dish to finish the meal.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our reserved table was immediately ready upon arrival. Our server was very friendly and sweet.\n\nI would definitely return to Brooklyn Cider House for a group dinner to do the prix-fixe and catch some cider again.', 'I\'ve been to Brooklyn Cider House twice -- once on a chill weekend afternoon to try their cider flight, and once with a group of four for the prix fixe dinner. People rave about the prix fixe, but I actually enjoyed my first time here better. The bar area in the front of the restaurant is really spacious and gets great sunlight. Our waiter was really helpful and happy to chat with us about the different types of cider in the flight we ordered, and give recommendations. He also gave me a free apple cider doughnut (it was perfect)!\n\nAs someone who loves cider, I expected to enjoy the prix fixe more than I did. First of all, the prix fixe menu was advertised to me as ""unlimited cider"" which it...kind of is? You catch cider in between each course (so 3 times in total), and during each ""catching"" you can technically drink as much as you want, while you stand there by the giant barrels. My preference at a dinner is generally to enjoy my drink with my food though, and not do shots of cider with other groups of people. I also felt like we were being rushed through the actual food courses to get to our cider catchings on time, which is also not my preference for a group meal.\n\nFor our dinner, we got the butternut squash soup, the spanish omelette and risotto, the steak, and the standard cheese plate to finish. The steak was amazing and a very generous portion. The rest of the food was fine. Given the quality of the steak and the amount of cider you get, I felt the price of $50 per person was fair. Glad we did it, but just not a dinner experience I need to have again. Would love to come back to drink cider at the bar and try their brunch/bar food offerings though!']",213,"['I came here with a group of 20 friends.  We booked the back room.

It's amazing that you can get your own cider right out of the barrels. What a wonderful experience... maybe next time!"", 'overall, the food needs some help BUT the location is beautiful, and the cider is AMAZING! service was good, we had to wait a little for the food, but there is so much to take in here we didnt mind. i love the dark, dim lighting and the wood feel. i would get a cider flight so you can try what youd like. the place is huge - theres a front indoor area, a front outdoor, and a whole back with various room. theres even some artwork for sale!\n\nas for the food....\n\nmy friend ordered the portobello burger. the bun looked amazing. the portobello was so damn small! we could barely see it. she wasnt impressed with it either. the yuca fries were undercooked.\n\nthe kimchi fried rice was a great dinner. i would get this again. for one, it was a big portion. two, there was FLAVOR. three, its not something i typically see outside of korean restaurants so i was happy! was it spicy? not that much at all.\n\nhouse nachos - veggie style. i highly suggest getting this. it was layered, filled with different flavors. very sharable and we both loved it.', ""I came here for brunch with a large group and had an absolute blast! First off, the cider tap was so much fun (quite an experience) where you stand far away from the barrel and taste it fresh. The cider flight was also delicious and definitely more tart then any cider I've had previously. For brunch, I got the chicken and waffles which included perfectly fried dark meat and fluffy waffles.\nThe outside space was also so much fun. Go for the cider and food, stay for the corn hole!"", ""Came here with a few friends for a drink and a bite to eat. This place is huge and it's pretty neat, they have a really interesting menu with various ciders.\nThe menu is pretty basic, I ended up getting the tacos and fries.\n\nIt took a really long time for our food to come out, and by the time it did, we had already finished our first round of drinks.\n\nThe tacos were average, the chicken was perfectly cooked but it was a bit too spicy for me.\nThe fries were nice and crispy , which was great.\nI was hoping they would have more gluten free options ,  but the menu is pretty limited.\n\nIt took a while for our check to come as well, But the server was pleasant.\n\nCute please to go in the summer for a cider/beer."", ""I was super excited as soon as I heard there was a Basque cider house opening up in NYC since my family is from that region. When going to a cider house in the Basque country, it's not just about the cider or the meal - it's also the experience and sharing it with a group of people. This place I believe is the second Basque cider house to open in the US.\n\nOnto the drank. The cider was delicious. FYI, Basque ciders are dry ciders that taste like the cask. Don't expect that sweet sugary stuff you get when you have an angry orchard. Also, to get your cider, you must get up and collect it yourself - straight from the casks!\n\nWe ordered the prix fixe menu which was extremely similar to what you would get in Spain. All was delicious and they do have a vegetarian option if you need one. However, I believe if you go that route, the whole table would have to get the vegetarian option as it's family sharing style. Meat fans will not want to make that sacrifice when their steak is a mouthwatering ribeye.\n\nOne difference I found from the Basque country is that here you can only go get cider 3 times in between courses. In Spain, this is unlimited and you simply get up and refill your glass whenever you want. However, I feel like this is for a reason and us New Yorkers wouldn't be able to control ourselves and it would be a madhouse. So 3 times is plenty and you do have the option of ordering more bottles to the table."", ""So sloooooooooooow.\n\nThe food was really good though. We split a whole roasted chicken and it was delicious (and only $26!).\n\nThe chicken is served with vegetables and it's really flavorful.\n\nBut yes the service is incredibly slow and don't expect to get your food in less than 20 minutes at least."", ""Came here with a page out of the Brooklyn Pub Pass book.\n\nWe walked in around 8ish last night. The place was a little emptier than a usual Friday night in Bushwick, probably due to the weather. We were seated almost right away.\n\nBrooklyn Cider House is a warehouse turned cidery/small restaurant that has delicious draft ciders and beers (and literal drafts, we felt cold!) with plenty of seating on the inside and out. Its walls are decorated with murals and its bar is well-lit to show off the gazillions of ciders they have to offer.\n\nTheir drink menu was obviously extensive but apparently not up to date. All the beer drafts listed on the menu were out. I went with one of the waiter's recommendation and had a Paradox Pilsner to start. It was smooth, sweet, and light, and seemed like a good pairing with the food I was about to order.\n\nI started with the Korean Wings as my appetizer. The wings came out hot, and were incredibly crispy, but a bit on the dry side. I was hoping for a little more soy ginger garlic sauce. Nonetheless they were still good.\n\nFor my entree I got the Applewood Bacon Cheese Burger. The burger came out juicy and delicious, and paired very well with my Pilsner. My friends enjoyed the chicken tacos that they ordered. The food did take a little on the longer side to come out but it was good.\n\nMy dessert beer was the Kim Red Raspberry Sour Lagrrr from Singlecut brewery. I'm not the biggest fan of sour beers, but this one wasn't too bad! I think the aftertaste of sugar is what made it a lot more drinkable. I would definitely have it again.\n\nI would come back if I'm in the area."", 'My family and I went to Brooklyn Cider House for weekend brunch and it was a great experience. Beyond the food, I highly recommend partaking in the cider catching, which is normally included in the prix-fixe dinner. Not only do you get to try the ciders straight from the barrels, but you also get to hear about the history of the restaurant/cider house and the Basque/European style of cider.\n\nThe different ciders are delicious. Depending on which ones you get, the flavours can range from sweet to sour. We ordered a flight to try different varieties.\n\nThe food is delicious, too. Many of the dishes rely on the natural flavours of the ingredients, not incorporating heavy or thick sauces. For me, the highlights were the cowboy ribeye steak and the tortilla de bacalao. The cowboy ribeye steak is thick and juicy; it was delicious. The tortilla de bacalao was light, and the sweetness from the caramelised onions and peppers complemented the cod. For dessert, the cider doughnuts were a sweet dish to finish the meal.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our reserved table was immediately ready upon arrival. Our server was very friendly and sweet.\n\nI would definitely return to Brooklyn Cider House for a group dinner to do the prix-fixe and catch some cider again.', 'I\'ve been to Brooklyn Cider House twice -- once on a chill weekend afternoon to try their cider flight, and once with a group of four for the prix fixe dinner. People rave about the prix fixe, but I actually enjoyed my first time here better. The bar area in the front of the restaurant is really spacious and gets great sunlight. Our waiter was really helpful and happy to chat with us about the different types of cider in the flight we ordered, and give recommendations. He also gave me a free apple cider doughnut (it was perfect)!\n\nAs someone who loves cider, I expected to enjoy the prix fixe more than I did. First of all, the prix fixe menu was advertised to me as ""unlimited cider"" which it...kind of is? You catch cider in between each course (so 3 times in total), and during each ""catching"" you can technically drink as much as you want, while you stand there by the giant barrels. My preference at a dinner is generally to enjoy my drink with my food though, and not do shots of cider with other groups of people. I also felt like we were being rushed through the actual food courses to get to our cider catchings on time, which is also not my preference for a group meal.\n\nFor our dinner, we got the butternut squash soup, the spanish omelette and risotto, the steak, and the standard cheese plate to finish. The steak was amazing and a very generous portion. The rest of the food was fine. Given the quality of the steak and the amount of cider you get, I felt the price of $50 per person was fair. Glad we did it, but just not a dinner experience I need to have again. Would love to come back to drink cider at the bar and try their brunch/bar food offerings though!']",,"['delivery', 'pickup']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-cider-house-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

We sat down, ordered some appetizers, and then ordered our burgers. The appetizers were ok, nothing special. Once the burgers came, my father already started feeling sick just from smelling the burger. My mother\'s was insanely dry that she couldn\'t even try it. Giving it another chance, my father tried his and insisted that it was spoiled and refused to eat it. They took the dry burger off from the bill, but we still had to pay for the one that seemed spoil. Although we were given a free dessert as an ""apology"", we still left feeling hungry, and my father\'s stomach started to hurt a lot on the way home.

Although it was a one time try for me, someone else in our group really enjoyed it.\n\nThe classic breakfast plate looked really good and came with a mushroom which made me drool a little bit.\n\nFull cocktail bar, but I opted for my cappuccino. Would be curious to see what menu they serve for dinner, as this place struck me more of the dinner ambiance type of place.', ""This restaurant is a must. Ate here last night for dinner and drinks and was very impressed with their food and drink menu. The staff was super warm and attentive! The ambience was fantastic - really has great vibes! Being a vegan, it's always tough eating out at a non vegan restaurants but at Cherry Point, they couldn't have been more helpful when it came to explaining what options I have to choose from - which there were quite a few!\n\nI highly recommend. Food: delicious. Staff: amazing. Decor: gorgeous. I will definitely be back for more!"", ""KenScale: 7.75/10\n\nWhen we check out new restaurants, my wife Jun and I rarely order the same dish twice, mostly because we want to try as many different dishes as possible before coming up with my KenScale (and for Jun her own score). On a recent early Sunday dinner, though, Jun did the unthinkable. After making a quick work of one of the two glazed lamb ribs served at Cherry Point in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she proceeded to order another set. The ribs were priced at $18 per two, with $9 per additional piece. I asked her if she was thinking of sharing the third one with me; she quickly shook her head and said she wants one full rib all by herself. Knowing that my wife loves good ribs in general, I didn't object and ordered another rib for myself. Based on the ribs, alone, is Cherry Point a great restaurant? Definitely, but then a single dish doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the restaurant. In a way, the experience at Cherry Point was a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nLet's talk about the ribs again for a second. You don't often see rib dishes made of lamb, presumably because of the difficulty with controlling the texture of this gamey meat. The kitchen behind Cherry Point more or less perfected the art of lamb cooking, and the glazed outside really did a wonderful magic, giving a beautiful contrast between the crust and the meat inside. The seasoning was also superbly balanced with yogurt and shallot without overpowering the texture of the lamb. No wonder Jun, astonished, quickly remarked that the lamb ribs at Cherry Point were some of the very best she had had in her lifetime. Cherry Point, with its British leaning menu, serves many dishes around meat. In addition to the lamb ribs, the beef tartare and bottarga on a toast was also solid with nice balance in flavor. The other meat dish we ordered, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. I understand Jun, always partial to duck meat (especially the breast), sets a pretty high standard when it comes to the poultry, but she was very puzzled after taking the first bite of the duck breast that came with bruleed pear and celeriac. The meat's texture was simply off although its color looked enticing. It wasn't clear what the kitchen exactly did, but either the meat seemed to be of poor quality or the right temperature wasn't applied. In any event, Jun declared the duck breast at Cherry Point one of the three worst she had had in her lifetime. The underwhelming duck breast certainly wasn't helped by the side dish of grilled asparagus with capers and basil which could've worked very well with the duck meat with its crunchy feel.\n\nGetting a reservation at Cherry Point online wasn't too challenging and the dining room was around half full in the course of our meal. We both really liked the casual neighborhood vibe of the restaurant which seems to be filled mostly with local Brooklynites; if the consistency of the food was there, I could have even considered Cherry Point in the gem category. There is full bar with some potent cocktail offerings that will help complement the food. In retrospect, as we were taking a walk from the restaurant to Williamsburg afterwards, I kept wondering if our dining experience would have completely changed had we ordered something other than the duck breast. If the duck were only half as decent, Cherry Point would have been comfortably within the solid 8.0 or more category in KenScale. It's a bit sad that we jumped from one of the best ribs my wife had ever had to one of the worst duck breast dishes she had ever had. I would certainly love to come back just for the ribs, though."", ""What an amazing find. I came here for dinner with a coupe of girlfriends and everything from the ambiance to the food, to service was phenomenal. Great for a date night or for small groups.

Walking around Greenpoint looking for a place to share some time together, my son, his girlfriend & I stopped here.  They had been here before yet it was my first experience.  We were pretty eclectic as they are both vegetarian and I eat a Keto lifestyle.\n\nMany good choices on the menu.  I look forward to coming back to enjoy what my son and his girlfriend ordered though I am not sure how those choices could be better than mine.\n\nHe had a breakfast sandwich that looked deconstructed on his plate.  He loved it.  She had baked eggs with spicy tomatoes served in a small cast iron pot.  It was steaming hot!  I will admit I took a taste of the spicy tomato & it was delicious.\n\nFor me -- the Traditional English Breakfast to include the blood sausage.  The blood sausage is not a typical go-to for me.  It was flavorful.\n\nThe bacon, sausage & eggs were perfect.  Add the roma tomatoes and the dish was complete.\n\nCoffee was good & strong.\n\nGreat breakfast.', ""An absolutely fantastic restaurant.  The food was delicious and the service exceptional.  I really liked that they offered complementary sparkling water that was refilled often.  The happy hour menu till 7pm didn't hurt either!\n\nThe menu has a nice assortment of meat, fish, and vegetable dishes-- the staff is very attentive to detail in explaining the ingredients and making sure that there are no food allergies or if there are any other preferences.\n\nWe started off with cocktails: dirty martini was strong yet made extremely well.\n\nFor appetizer, we first ordered the grilled dodge coves (oysters) served partially cooked over smoking rosemary and in a sort of Dijon mustard sauce which was sooo good (even for folk that don't usually eat oysters).  Second, we ordered the charcuterie board with two types of meat (prosciutto and alpine cervelet) and cheese-- a full delicious board with butter, mustard, jam and bread.  Third, a beet salad which was outstanding.\n\nFor main course, the glazed lamb rib was some of the best I've ever had ($18 for two nice sized ribs). Other hits were the sweet potato gnocchi and steak.\n\nMust try dessert would be the sticky toffee pudding- we couldn't eat enough.  The citrus posset and ice cream were fantastic as well.\n\nCherry point is an ideal restaurant for all occasions and I look forward to returning to try the rest of the menu."", 'We were crazy enough to try to make it over to Forrest Point for brunch on a Sunday, and of course there was a 1.5 hour wait. I was like HECK NOOOOO!!! And the group managed to walk around and find this cute little spot.\n\nIt was dimly lit, cozy, and a little hidden even. Slight wait, good service, and pretty decent food. I was craving the ricotta pancakes over at Forrest Point, but got the baked eggs here instead along with the scotch eggs (I know... your girl likes her eggs). The scotch eggs were quite unique (small quail egg with a layer of what seemed to be meat, fried on the outside) on top of a thick mustard. Although it was a one time try for me, someone else in our group really enjoyed it.\n\nThe classic breakfast plate looked really good and came with a mushroom which made me drool a little bit.\n\nFull cocktail bar, but I opted for my cappuccino. Would be curious to see what menu they serve for dinner, as this place struck me more of the dinner ambiance type of place.', ""This restaurant is a must. Ate here last night for dinner and drinks and was very impressed with their food and drink menu. The staff was super warm and attentive! The ambience was fantastic - really has great vibes! Being a vegan, it's always tough eating out at a non vegan restaurants but at Cherry Point, they couldn't have been more helpful when it came to explaining what options I have to choose from - which there were quite a few!\n\nI highly recommend. Food: delicious. Staff: amazing. Decor: gorgeous. I will definitely be back for more!"", ""KenScale: 7.75/10\n\nWhen we check out new restaurants, my wife Jun and I rarely order the same dish twice, mostly because we want to try as many different dishes as possible before coming up with my KenScale (and for Jun her own score). On a recent early Sunday dinner, though, Jun did the unthinkable. After making a quick work of one of the two glazed lamb ribs served at Cherry Point in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she proceeded to order another set. The ribs were priced at $18 per two, with $9 per additional piece. I asked her if she was thinking of sharing the third one with me; she quickly shook her head and said she wants one full rib all by herself. Knowing that my wife loves good ribs in general, I didn't object and ordered another rib for myself. Based on the ribs, alone, is Cherry Point a great restaurant? Definitely, but then a single dish doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the restaurant. In a way, the experience at Cherry Point was a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nLet's talk about the ribs again for a second. You don't often see rib dishes made of lamb, presumably because of the difficulty with controlling the texture of this gamey meat. The kitchen behind Cherry Point more or less perfected the art of lamb cooking, and the glazed outside really did a wonderful magic, giving a beautiful contrast between the crust and the meat inside. The seasoning was also superbly balanced with yogurt and shallot without overpowering the texture of the lamb. No wonder Jun, astonished, quickly remarked that the lamb ribs at Cherry Point were some of the very best she had had in her lifetime. Cherry Point, with its British leaning menu, serves many dishes around meat. In addition to the lamb ribs, the beef tartare and bottarga on a toast was also solid with nice balance in flavor. The other meat dish we ordered, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. I understand Jun, always partial to duck meat (especially the breast), sets a pretty high standard when it comes to the poultry, but she was very puzzled after taking the first bite of the duck breast that came with bruleed pear and celeriac. The meat's texture was simply off although its color looked enticing. It wasn't clear what the kitchen exactly did, but either the meat seemed to be of poor quality or the right temperature wasn't applied. In any event, Jun declared the duck breast at Cherry Point one of the three worst she had had in her lifetime. The underwhelming duck breast certainly wasn't helped by the side dish of grilled asparagus with capers and basil which could've worked very well with the duck meat with its crunchy feel.\n\nGetting a reservation at Cherry Point online wasn't too challenging and the dining room was around half full in the course of our meal. We both really liked the casual neighborhood vibe of the restaurant which seems to be filled mostly with local Brooklynites; if the consistency of the food was there, I could have even considered Cherry Point in the gem category. There is full bar with some potent cocktail offerings that will help complement the food. In retrospect, as we were taking a walk from the restaurant to Williamsburg afterwards, I kept wondering if our dining experience would have completely changed had we ordered something other than the duck breast. If the duck were only half as decent, Cherry Point would have been comfortably within the solid 8.0 or more category in KenScale. It's a bit sad that we jumped from one of the best ribs my wife had ever had to one of the worst duck breast dishes she had ever had. I would certainly love to come back just for the ribs, though."", ""What an amazing find. I came here for dinner with a coupe of girlfriends and everything from the ambiance to the food, to service was phenomenal. Great for a date night or for small groups.

I went here twice, and I notice their menu changes seasonally. We started off with their house cocktails, then the famous Barruta, which contains pesto, marinated squash, cranberry sauce and barruta cheese, it was devoured in seconds. We each ordered different entrees, I got the mussels since I've heard that they're extremely wonderful. The flavor of course didn't disappoint, the portion was large as well- a whole pot of it! The mussels were cooked in white wine and vegetables, creating a special broth to soak the mussels in. My friends also claimed that their entrees were delicious, not a single complaint. Finally we ordered their dessert of the day to round up our meal- what a fantastic dining experience!!!\nOverall I'd say the food is brilliant and the service is extraordinary! During quarantine they have outdoor seating in their beautiful patio, with socially distant tables, heat lamps and tons of hand sanitizer available. The only takeaway is that dining isn't exactly affordable, it can only be an experience once in a while."", ""Otis is seriously the bomb.

We were told someone would come get us, but then 10 minutes later, one of the waiters came by and apologized that they had accidentally seated the party behind us because WE had failed to find the waiter ourselves.

The kiddos got the kid special of two mini- classic panzerotti and an organic juice (which was part juice part cane sugar). Classic is the closest to a calzone if you use amazing sauce and fresh mozzarella. I went for the artichoke, which is a bit like a white pizza with artichokes, but much lighter yet satisfying. For dessert, they offer what seems at first like a variation of a fried Oreo. It\'s a panzerotti with Nutella inside! You can get either chocolate or vanilla flavored dough. Once it came out it appears to be more like an Italian chocolate croissant - either way the kids loved it.\n\nTo top things off, and this is a HUGE deal - the owners ran things top to bottom and were so friendly! It\'s refreshing to have such polite and sincere service and really stands out.\n\nIt\'s clear from other reviews here that a lot of other people are excited to have them in the hood and you can add me to that list.

We got the baked Classic and spicy Salame for two of us for dinner. They came out quickly and were steaming hot. We split them in half to share. I was surprised by the GIANT pocket of air that makes up most of the panzerotti, with just a lump of (albeit delicious) filling at the bottom. They didn\'t seem very substantial, but we were full eating one ""bite"" each. The mozzarella was ~divine~ and the salame has a nice hint of spicy without being too much.\n\nThere\'s plenty of seating in the restaurant so it\'s great for larger groups (tables for 4 plus a couch area). The owner was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and willing to answer any questions. The pricing is pretty steep for essentially a rearranged pizza, but it\'s comparable to the neighborhood.

I don't usually like falafel but I really like the flavor of these and the crispiness on the outside and gooyeness on the inside.

I waitlisted on Resy for an outdoor table and when I arrived I asked for an indoor table. Not expecting to be accommodated since they are a small place and it was 7pm on a Friday night, they did!!! They moved around tables for us and then at 8:30pm we knew that they had a reservation coming in and we were going to leave but she was kind enough to let us know she can move us to a high top since there was a no show to enjoy another drink and we did.\nOkay, so on to more important things here. The food was phenomenal. We started with the semolina pita and duck liver mousse. The bread is baked fresh as you order. Amaze balls!! The duck liver mousse is also amaze balls. We then had the grilled clams which were also amazing, I was drinking the sauce wishing for more bread but knowing I couldn\'t eat more bread. We then had the lamb meatballs which we surprisingly so good meaning full of unexpected flavor and spice.\nFor our entrees we shared two pasta dishes. One of the dishes just sparked my curiosity based on the name. ""Everything Bagel Fettucine with smoked trout roe"" I love everything bagels. I love smoked trout and roe but never had smoked trout roe so I\'m sure I would love it and I did. The pasta was fresh and delicate. The seasoning was good and not over powering. The smoked trout roe was a great addition with delicate but strong smokiness. We then had the bucatini (one of my fav pasta) with wild boar ragout. That was also another great dish. The fresh pasta was perfectly cooked and there were chunks of wild boar. Meaning not ground or chopped meat but meat that has been cooking until it\'s tender and breaking up naturally.\nThey had a cheese plate for dessert but we were full and looking for something small and sweet.\nShe then gave us a little appertif and I usually don\'t care for them but this was very good and unusual in a good way.', ""This place deserves all the love.

Not disgustingly large, but definitely not cheaped out.\n\nFood tasted great: got the gyro, hummus, and pita. You can taste the real ingredients as opposed to just the store bought things. Well worth, can't wait for COVID to be over so I can dine in the restaurant!"", ""I've been following P&C on Instagram since they opened last summer, but finally had a chance to swing by last week.  I'm not sure what took us so long to finally visit, but this is gonna be part of our list of trusted and reliable local spots!  Note that P&C are only open for dinner, and Sunday brunch.  Also, as far as I know, there is also free corkage on Mondays!\n\nP&C is small and cozy, with a bar seating and several 2-seater tables and high tops (which can be pushed together for larger parties).  My husband and I didn't have reservations, but we were able to grab a spot.  While the menu isn't huge, there were so many delicious things to choose from.  There are a few larger main dishes, but everything is meant to be shared.\n\nTo start, we ordered: roasted brussels sprouts, 2 pita (rye, and seeded semolina), along with the following dips: Bottarga, Chicken Gizzards, and Chevre.  We also added on the braised wagyu, so we were pretty stuffed at the end of the meal.  \n\nStarting with the pita - oh my god, where has this been all my life?!  These pitas are totally different from what you would expect from a regular pita. Standard pitas are just flour, yeast, and 60% hydration.  The ones served by P&C are made-to-order in a stone oven, and is made from a high hydration dough (possibly 75-80% water?), and uses a sour dough starter.  High hydration dough gives a better rise, and more of an open crumb (open holes), similar to those beautiful artisan loaves.  The sourdough starter and the use of different flours (and seeds) are important for flavour development.  Once it comes out of the oven, the outside is crispy, toasty, and covered with slightly burnt spots, with a soft and airy crumb.. and that is why this is honestly, hands down, THE BEST FREAKIN PITA EVER MADE!\n\nThat was a long speel about pita, but onto the next best thing - the accompaniments! Our favorite were the chicken gizzards - this was a hot dish, cooked nice and tender, in a spicy tomato sauce.  The other dips were nice as well - the bottarga (cured fish roe) was grated on top of an onion dip (mix of sour cream, onion, and something else that had a slight funk to it).  The Chevre was whipped goat cheese sprinkled with leek ash (heavily roasted leeks), and drizzled with olive oil.  Honestly, all the dips were so good, but they have some other interesting ones that sound great.  It will be hard to pick which ones to try the next time we go! \n \nThe brussel sprouts were alright - I liked the acidity on the dish, but it felt like perhaps the sprouts were steamed/boiled, then roasted.  I loved the charred bits, which gave it a nice smokey flavor but maybe because the sprouts were smaller in size, they got a bit softer / mushier?  Flavor was great, but felt slightly overcooked.  \n\nThe entree that we shared was the braised wagyu beef served with little potatoes.  The beef melted in my mouth, and while it was nicely seasoned and was a delicious dish overall - my personal preference on wagyu beef is still enjoying it grilled or seared medium rare. \n\nThere were no duds tonight, but I'm looking forward to future visits and trying different things, such as the shakshuka & cheeky benny (served on Sunday brunch only), the roasted clams, smoked trout roe, duck liver mousse, dry aged meatballs, wild boar ragout bucatini, the tripe.. the menu seems to get changed around every now and then, so just keep your eyes peeled on their online menu."", ""AMAZING.\n\nI will be coming back here. Everything on this menu was superb. When I say superb, I mean it was cooked, seasoned and presented excellently. The staff is welcoming and very friendly. This place has the best pita I have ever had. Pita isn't my favorite bread, its a good bread to have sauces and dips but I could have eaten their pita by itself, a whole bowl full.\n\nYou will not be dissapointed."", ""I decided to surprise my brother with mystery delivery food! I do not live in Brooklyn, he does, so I just chose the restaurant based on Yelp reviews.\n\nI got him the Crepe Savoyarde and the prosciutto and melon salad.\n\nThe food absolutely blew his mind! He said it wasn't something he'd ever pick for himself but he was glad I picked it for him and although this was a few weeks ago now, he still brings it up! And the pictures he sent looked absolutely gorgeous... not an easy feat for delivery food to look great!""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomp-and-circumstance-dining-williamsburg?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

The small bar and restaurant had a nice mix of breakfast and lunch items and a long list of cocktails, though I stuck with only food. We started with two breakfast dishes, the Classic Benedict and the French Toast Sticks. And while the Classic Benedict was fine, the French Toast Sticks were great. Rare to see this item on menus, but they had great consistency and were easy to share. We also dived into the lunch section with the The Burger and the Mini Mac & Cheese. I found the burger okay, with the chipotle mayo as a nice touch, but it was  served as a soggy mess. The french fries they came with had way too much pepper, but since we ordered so much it wasn't a big loss skipping them. The Mini Mac & Cheese was pretty good, but by that point in the meal I was too full to truly enjoy it.\nQuantity: We ordered way too much food. Two dishes would have been more than enough for us.\nValue: $14 for the Classic Benedict. $11 for the French Toast Sticks. $16 for The Burger. $9 for the Mini Mac & Cheese.\nAmbiance: 191 Knickerbocker is located in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn. When you enter they have a bar on the left and rows of tables along the right wall. The space has a very casual feel, with a weird unrelated collection of art on the wall.

The bread is made from similar dough to Neapolitan pizza so it's lighter and chars well but it's still flat like a wrap.

I love it because I love to axe throwing.\n\nI went to a fellow Yelpers axe throwing bio celebration back in February and since then I was hooked. Since that one time I've tried another ace throwing location that I will not name and it was not up to par.\n\nMy coworkers organized a group event here at kick axe and I fell in love.\n\nThe decor, the instructors, the cleanliness of the location and the fact that they change the boards often is what sold me.\n\nThe pricing per session is about $38/39 for 1.5 hours. If you have a larger group (12) you'll receive your own lane. Light snacks (pizza) is sold here and they have lots of beer and canned Rosé. Unfortunately it is not BYOB like other axe throwing locations but the drink prices are reasonable.\n\nI've been here probably 4 times in the last year and I recently celebrated my birthday with a group of 23 other friends here. I wanted to share my love of axe throwing with my closest friends.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this location is the fact that there are no fans or some kind of air conditioning system. I've been here in just about every season and I'm always sweating. Granted yes I'm performing a physical activity but there is never any air circulation. Besides that this place is perrdr to me.\n\nI will 100% return for more axe throwing and who knows maybe I'll join a league or something."", ""Who knew throwing axes would be so much fun? Initially, I thought it would be difficult but I got the hang of it pretty fast. I think axe throwing might be my calling in life. We registered online and signed waivers as soon as we entered. They have a bar, snacks, and Table 87 pizza while you wait.\n\nThe instructors we had were pretty nice and encouraging. Some of the target boards were in pretty bad shape which affected whether or not our axe throws stuck to the board or not, I think. Also, it can get loud and cramped. Also, unless you have a group of 8 or more, you probably have to share two lanes with another group.\n\nThey make competitions out of each round and it's pretty fun. I would totally do this again."", ""I had tons of fun here. All you need is an open mind and enjoy friendly competition. It's like darts but with axes. The cost to play is $35 per person. You can have a group of no more than 12 on a range. That will allow the trainer to break you up into two teams for the games. I have to say, getting the axe to stick in the wood was a challenge, but with practice I definitely got better. The trainer is with you the entire time to give pointers, ensure you are safe and to keep score.\n\nThe more people playing the tighter the waiting area on the range becomes. Therefore you can't have any issues with close quarters. Lol.\n\nKick axe has a bar and offers some food, like pizza.\n\nThe main waiting area has some couches, jenga, and connect four.\n\nI went on a Saturday at 7:00 and it was pretty busy.\n\nI think it's worth a try. I only gave 4 stars bc of the time allotments. It's either 1 hour and 15 min or 2 hours and 45min. I feel like I could've used another 1/2 hour on my reservation but the almost 3 hours would've been way too long."", ""Had a great time bringing a party of 16 first timers (including myself) to Kick Axe this past weekend!\n\nWe had to arrive a little early to sign waivers (doesn't take long), and waited with our buzzer until it was our turn. We booked two ranges and had ample time to throw axes which was nice because we had a little corner of the area to ourselves.\n\nThe staff were extremely friendly and carefully walked us through do's, dont's on axe throwing and tbh, throwing axe is actually a lot harder than I thought haha\n\nWe also played two games to spice things up a bit and definitely got us motivated to get better at axe throwing. The bar was also a great additional to our experience and definitely would come back again."", ""I am here with my cousins for a holiday gathering it was such a great time !

We're so glad you enjoyed your holiday party with us, April!"", ""Great place to have events. The event is fun in which you and your party play at least three round of games against each other. The instructor will use the initial round to teach the party on how to throw axes and proper postures for throwing axes. Later rounds are for fine tuning and to find the best process, force, and dynamic to throw axes. I can see this event as team building event and to build some competition : )\n\nThe only con of this place is that they turned the AC so high that it was very cold inside. The super cold feeling wasn't enjoyable... Everything else was fine"", ""Stuff was very friendly.\nIntroduce lots of different way to play\nAnd very nice environment\nFor me it's bit hard to throw.

Given that we both got sick right at the same time, the only logical conclusion was that it was the food. The other thing that bothered me (a lot) was that another group came in while we were eating. They seemed very friendly with the staff so I assume they frequent the restaurant often. They were walking around the pickup area (right next to where I was seated) without even wearing a mask. The restaurant staff only asked them to take a seat and did not ask they wear a mask. We are at the all-time high of hospitalizations across NY and the nation from covid. What the heck? To add insult to injury, someone in that groyp was wearing a ton of cheap perfume and that was all I could taste/smell for a few pieces. When they went to get seated, a few of them still didn't where a mask as they walked right by us. No excuse for this. Maybe it was off day for the food but there should be no off day for safety. Needless to say, these guys won't be getting our business going forward."", 'The omakse here is a great fusion of tradition and innovation. They incorporate creative toppings and sauces/glazes, but not to the point of overpowering the fish.\n\nThe sashimi platter to start featured, besides sashimi, two pieces of steamed (?) octopus, which was a great palatte cleanse.\n\nThe first sushi piece was one of my faves: scallop with light yuzu sauce. Some other favs include the ebi with a dollop of uni on top, the toro with shaved mushrooms, the uni, and the hand roll. They do not skimp on uni here!\n\nThe only bone I have to pick is that they use fried toppings like garlic chips and fried onions on some pieces, which I personally think cheapens the bite.\n\nSide note - seems like they are not very busy on weeknights.\n\nWould definitely come again!', ""Great choice for a value + high quality omakase, esp outside of Manhattan. It didn't bump other spots out of my top 5 but it's solid. I've been wanting to try this and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe full omakase at $100 is definitely filling with plenty of appetizers of fresh sashimi prepared different ways, oysters, soup, and egg custard. By the end of that, you already start to feel your belly getting full. The oysters were fresh (3 different kids), the sashimi preparation with different flavors was enjoyable, and the custard was warm and comforting!\n\nFor the nigiri pieces (~8), they were all beautifully prepared and you can tell a lot of love goes into it. The rice is decent but not the BEST in town, and the pieces are modest sizes (meaning average slice). Flavors are great. Chef Lin pairs ingredients well and even certain methods like lightly torching this vs that makes all the difference. Based on the fish offered, you definitely get your money's worth (uni MULTIPLE times throughout the meal, caviar, toro, etc.)\n\nChef Lin is a delight. He wasn't able to interact during our appetizers as it seemed he was focused on prepping everything AND for other orders (busy counter and they do take out) but as time went on he was able to interact a bit more, which is always a plus to an omakase experience.\n\nDessert was DELICIOUS. It was a sesame pudding in brown sugar. Mmmm..\n\nI thought we'd be out in 1 hr 15-30 mins but it took almost 2 hours. However it didn't feel like we were waiting to long in btw pieces. We just had somewhere to go, so keep that in mind if you have other commitments.\n\nOverall solid spot and definitely make a reservation!"", ""Great omakase spot in Brooklyn.

I have been to this restaurant several times in the past and have found the food to be consistently good, the staff very friendly, and the quality to be top notch.  I know it's not the cheapest food around but considering how generous the portions are, it's still a good value.  I have been able to eat two, sometimes three meals from one platter.  Some of my personal favorites are the purple cabbage salad, the shredded beet salad, and the shredded carrot salad with the little pieces of preserved lemon.  And of course, the pickles!  How could I forget the pickles?!  Try their food and I am sure you will love it.  And if you have already tried it (and still have an income), treat yourself to some delicious take out.

Everything I had was phenomenal but especially the malai kofta. My husband ate from this place twice in one week, it was so good.\nWould highly recommend for amazing Indian food in Brooklyn."", ""This is my first Yelp review and it's not like I am new to Yelp. I am OBSESSED with Yelp. I use it as a menu for most restaurants I go to and my friends make fun of me but it's how I roll. Anyway, I guess everyone has there moment where they realize it's time to stop using Yelp for the benefits and start giving back through reviews. That moment for me was tonight at Indika House. Full disclosure - I am giving this review before I even taste the food. I'll comment back and update when I do get the food, but for now, they've already earned 5 stars and beyond. I just got off the phone with a dude who I wish I got his name but he was so friken human in these insane times. I messed up my order - that's not true - I ordered and then realized there was a takeout deal and wanted to try and cancel and re-order. I called the restaurant and the guy was so chill. He worked with me, he understood I was just tryna get that deal and didn't hold it against me. He fixed the order without including annoying GrubHub service and basically threw in a naan. This just doesn't happen. People are busy and stressed and hardly ever take the time to re-work an order for some girl in Williamburg who wants to save 3 bucks. THANK YOU TO THE DUDE ON THE PHONE. You're awesome and you've got my business forever."", 'What a delicious way to end a long weekend. I dipped the soft and delicate garlic naan in every spice and sauce they gave me. The $18 special with one of each category is the perfect way to have dinner in the COVID world because the selection is enormous on the list from vegetarian to pescatarian they offer a wide range. But what is really impressive is that the food arrived piping hot. It has flavor that you would not believe unless your tried it. So, try it.', 'Fabulous! I ordered Chicken Tikki, Lamb Keba and Naan and...Veggie Samosas! Oh it was delish! The driver was on time and very polite.\nI will definitely order from Indika House again! Great Job!', ""Ordered through DoorDash but had to leave a Yelp review after tasting the food - this place is bomb. Probably the best Indian food I've ever had in my life. Everything we ordered had the perfect balance of spice and flavor. Definitely found our new go-to Indian place."", ""I rarely write reviews and am rarely impressed but the food at this place is amazing!!  I just moved to the neighborhood and have had some difficulty finding good quality food so I'm stoked... so far, I have ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chicken saag and both were delicious!  The rice was perfect and everything tasted spot on!!  Highly recommended..."", 'Really good food. I ordered the take out deal with fish tikka and chicken korma and the food came hot. The naan was huge and soft and absolutely delicious. There was also a side of kheer which was nice and not overly sweet like indian deserts tend to be. I do wish there were more than 2 pieces of fish tikka because I enjoyed it so much but I was told it was gonna be a small portion when I ordered so I appreciate that. There were a few solid cashew pieces in the gravy which I thought would be blended but the taste was so good and creamy that I just chewed the pieces up.\nWill be ordering again !', ""I love it here. I was in for the lunch special.\n\nFor under 15$ including tip I had a delicious lunch. Chicken tikki masala, lentils, rice and a side of naan.\nIt was all savory, fresh and made with love. The service was friendly. The music was relaxing and the murals kept my attention the whole meal.\n\nI'll be a regular here."", 'Great spot for delicious Indian food! I think this will now be my go-to Indian spot in this neighborhood. Their prices are good for the quality that you get here.\n\nMy first time trying this place, I decided to share the Butter Chicken and the Chicken Korma, since those are easy staples that are hard to get wrong. Both were really flavorful and the chicken was tender. Will definitely be back to explore the rest of their menu!\n\nGlad to support a well run family-owned business.', ""This is easily some of the best and most delicious Indian food I have ever eaten on the East Coast. I've always been disappointed by Indian food in New York but after Indika House I think I've found the perfect Indian Restaurant where almost every single thing we've ordered has been finger licking good! Everything from the Lamb Biryani to the Mango Lassi to the Chefs Special Lamb Curry and the Kababs are delicious. You can't go wrong with this place.

Perfect app for 2, but I can easily finish 1 on my own.\n2. Duccboi - Is the kind of burger that you\'d want to date and end up marrying. Really juicy and flavorful, and definitely one of a kind. I heard it takes days to make so you know a lot of TLC was given this burger and the taste definitely shows it. This burger will treat you right.\n3. Chicken rice - Reminds me of the Hainese style chicken rice that is savory and aromatic served at Malaysian restaurants. The ginger on top is such a nice complement. I dont recall Malaysian places doing it, but I\'m won with the chopped ginger.\n\nWait staff was very accommodating, and outdoor seating is available due to COVID.

I ordered both a burger and a rice dish + sides because I literally wanted it all and it did not disappoint. Needless to say, was definitely full after the meal.\n\nThe pulled pork in the O.G. burger was super tender, juicy on it's own. But with all the other elements in the burger (kai lan relish & egg).. it's a whole new level. Love this burger, this is a MUST try.\n\nSweet & Sour Pork Belly - absolutely loved this. The pork belly was on the fattier side (which I'm a fan of) and I loved the tangy kick from the pineapples. Another must try dish if you're a rice and pork belly fan. (Also heard the sichuanese eggplant over rice is good but didn't get a chance to try).\n\nTaro Tots - uh... I can't believe I've never encountered these delicious tots. I personally love tater tots but taro tots? Um, yes please. The concept of it sounded amazing and you know what - this place killed it. The taro tots are sooooooo good on its own but the sauces make it extra unique. I tried it with both the chili aioli and dau si barbecue sauce and they're both amazing. At first, I liked the chili aioli more but the more I had the dau si barbecue sauce, the more I like it. I mean, if you know what dau si is and you like dau si, then you will like this. Literally cannot go wrong with this unique sauce.\n\nOk last one I swear - the smashed cucumber - just get it.\n\nMy friends had the NRB Burger + DUCCboi (I took a bite of this heh) and both said these burgers were A+++.\n\nCan't wait to be back.

The skin was just chewy enough to complement the explosion of flavor hidden within the dumplings. Another great appetizer was the mushrooms. Pretty amazing how the chef is able to turn something healthy into something so delicious.\n\nFor the main appetizer we had the NRB burger, and it was once again another infusion of East meets West. The cheesy corn and daikon are an amazing complementary piece to the old traditional burger. I just wish I had ordered 2 more to go.\n\nThe ambience is great. Love the lighting. Great table service. Would 100% come back when I'm in the area."", 'So salty! Not sure how this place has 5 stars, very misleading.\n\nBurger was the best thing we ordered but no option to do as medium.\n\nOctopus was over cooked and the sauce was horrible.\n\nChicken was overly salted', 'I chose Jook Sing as my first dine-in restaurant since covid hit so that means it\'s been more than half a year since I\'ve dined inside a restaurant.  Wow.\n\nI came here after seeing a clip on the Fung Bros.  Everything looked so freaken delicious so I really wanted to come check it out.  The burger spot next door which was also featured on the same Fung Bros clip also looked delicious so I will need to come back to try that spot.  The people that work here are super nice and very accommodating.  The restaurant is located in a busy area where there is a lot of foot traffic.  It\'s great for a night out.  There are lots of other restaurants nearby so kudos to them on picking a good location and offering variety to the neighborhood and community.  Parking in the area is extremely hard though so if you are going to come, plan to come during nonpeak time or you will probably have a tough time finding parking.  A lot of the streets nearby are also closed for the outdoor dining so that also doesn\'t help the parking situation.  \n\nDuroc Pork Wontons - these were delicious.  They make for a great appetizer/small plate.  I recommend these if you like wontons.\n\nTaro Tots - I love taro in most foods and this was no exception.  These were so so so good and they are so much healthier than regular potato tots.  If you are not a fan of taro, the taro taste isn\'t that strong so you should be fine.  I definitely recommend ordering this to share.\n\nDUCCboi - this is a ""burger"" except instead of beef, it comes with peking duck.  If you like peking duck, definitely give this a try.  It is a nice spin on the classic burger and something different than a ""boring"" old burger.\n\nNRB burger - this is a bulbogi burger and this was also really good.  I love bulgogi and the fact that this was in burger form, I knew I had to try it.  I also really liked the cheesey-corn and the ssamjang aioli.  That complimented the bulgogi really well.  I definitely recommend ordering this too.\n\nRed Braised Chicken - this is soy simmered chicken.  This was just okay to me.  It was good, but not a must get.\n\nSweet & Sour Pork Belly - I really enjoyed this.  The pork belly had the perfect amount of fat.  I normally don\'t like sweet and sour sauce or pineapple, but this wasn\'t bad and actually went pretty great with the pork belly.\n\nBig Bao - This is a pork bun.  I am not a fan of baos and definitely not pork baos, but I wanted to try it because the photos of it looked amazing.  This was okay to me so I wouldn\'t say it\'s a must get.  I would lower the price on this a bit.  I think $7 for this is a bit expensive and not worth what you\'re getting.\n\nChicken Stock Rice - I love chicken stock rice.  It\'s one of those guilty pleasures in life and you should treat yourself once in a while because life is short ya know?  I recommend getting this to accompany your entrees.  This was pretty tasty and I would be happy just eating this by itself.  I would lower the price on this a bit though since $4 is a bit steep for a bowl of rice, even if it\'s chicken stock rice.\n\nGarlic Kai Lan - This is your typical Chinese broccoli.  When eating Chinese food, you need a side of Chinese veggies and this dish was it.  This was okay.  It tasted as you would expect.  $7 is about going rate for this type of dish, but you usually get more.  $7 for the portion size served here is steep.  So I recommend lowering the price or keeping the price, but increasing the portion size.  Otherwise, I would recommend skipping this and eating this at traditional Chinese restaurant or make it yourself at home.\n\nTyphoon Shelter Mushroom - I love all types of mushroom so I had to try this.  I was a bit disappointed in this dish since it was just okay.  I\'ve never heard of or had the mushrooms that are in this dish before so that was interesting to try.  This dish is a toss up on whether or not I recommend ordering.  The flavors weren\'t there to wow me enough and definitely not at $15 =(.\n\nOverall, I had a good meal here.  I love spots like this.  I like it when chefs are adventurous and come up with new recipes based on traditional dishes.  I especially love the name of this place since it resonates with me.  If you are looking to try something new, I recommend checking this place out.  Yes, some things were great and some things were just okay for me.  I foresee the menu changing seasonally based on customer reviews and also what\'s in season etc.  I think that\'s great for a small restaurant like this since it\'ll keep customers returning to check out new dishes.', ""They offer lunch sets during the weekdays from 12pm to 3pm.\n\nI ordered set a and set d , you can't do wrong with either. My favorite tho is set d, their burger is sooooooooo yummy and juicy like ohh mann you should deff try it ! It's one of the best burger I had. Since I got it to go, I asked if the bun can be separate so the buns won't get soggy. It also comes with a side of taro tots which were soo crispy and flavorful. If you want to try something knee that you really can't get anywhere else deff try set d. If you don't want soda you can get one of their sparkling drinks for +$1 more.\n\nI will deff come back to try their other lunch set."", 'Everything about my experience at Jook Sing was amazing, from the outdoor ambiance, to the amazing service, to the eclectic asian fusion dishes.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were warmly greeted by our server and were seated at their brightly lit outdoor dining area. Our server recommended us to try the typhoon shelter mushrooms, nrb burger, ma la wings, duroc pork wontons, and the cold sesame cucumber. Each dish was plated very well and the taste were all uniquely delicious! My favorites were the ma la wings and typhoon shelter mushrooms. They were a great mixture of our favorite asian flavors prepared in an American way!\n\nWould highly recommend everyone to try Jook Sing!', ""Decided to check this spot out after seeing them featured on Fubg Bros. Between myself and three other people we ordered: Mala chicken wings, braised chicken, taro tots, octopus special, spicy wontons, the pork bao, and a jade Cesar salad. Everything was fantastic! There wasn't anything I disliked or thought wasn't executed well.\n\nMy favorite was the Cesar salad. It presented some new flavors in a familiar form factor--a must try for those always looking to expand their palette.\n\nReally reasonably priced, especially for Williamsburg. Bring some friends and order tapas style to sample everything. You won't be disappointed. Hopefully they get a liquor license soon!""]",,"['delivery', 'pickup']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jook-sing-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

While they do have a few seats, almost everyone takes the food to go.\n\nWith the exception of a few sandwiches, every meal that I've gotten there probably breaks the $10 mark, but the quality of ingredients is good, and the dishes taste like they were made in a neighbor's kitchen. My favorite thing to get is the lunch bowl ($10.99), also a great thing to get if it's your first time there so you can try more things at once, since it includes a protein, grain, and vegetable. The combination I get most often is with turkey meatballs, mujaddara (lentils and rice), and chicory with caramelized onions, but all of the vegetable dishes and salads we've had have tasted healthy and delicious.

Ethiopian food is one of my favorite cuisines, and I love that everything here is vegan/plant-based, meaning I can just about eat everything here!\n\nMy favorites are the Shiro and the Ras Kitfo, with injera, of course. I have been asking for them to be made with less oil than they standardly use (which is quite a bit), and they have done so most of the time (not every time, but that's ok). Lots of flavor from robust herbs and spices. Spicy, but not too spicy.\n\n(The standard injera does contain gluten, and even though I eat gluten-free, my stomach seems to be ok with the injera. I'm guessing it's a small enough amount of gluten to not bother me. But they do have gluten-free injera, but you have to order a day in advance.)\n\nI've also had their Mama's Tofu and Misir, and they were delicious but just a tad too spicy for my preferences. I think I tried asking for the Mama's Tofu to be made less spicy once, and it wasn't any different, so I've just stuck with my favorites that I know I can tolerate.\n\nThere are a bunch of other entrees that I would love to try, but they don't seem to be as high in protein based on the ingredients, and I prefer the dishes based on chickpea, lentils, or the pea protein crumble in the kitfo to make sure I feel full enough.

However, this establishment the ""featured"" or ""special"" item is one one side and does not include all the additional sides.\n\nOur waitress luckily helped me because it was not registering in my brain.

While I'm sure dining there would have been even better, we were completely satisfied with our delivery experience and can't wait to order again soon.\n\nThe menu is completely vegan, but most of my favorite Ethiopian dishes are plant-based anyway, so I didn't miss the meat at all. We got the sampler (which came with 5 different dishes) and the mushroom tibs with injera, and lentil sambusa on the side. All of it was delicious, and we would order any of those again.

Every bite of springy injera filled with the deeply flavorful Ras special tibs I ordered brought me instant comfort and joy. I invited a couple of self-described carnivorous friends to join me for a meal here and I believe they were genuine in saying they didn't miss the meat. I think Ethiopian food is a fun meal to have with friends, on a date, or even solo since it's hearty and so hands on and I wholeheartedly recommend anyone go out of their way to visit Ras.\n\nWe started with the sambusa, an appetizer with a flaky pastry shell and a savory filling of either mixed veggies or lentils. Our server recommended the lentils since it was more toothsome and I'm glad I took his advice because it was a big hit at my table, especially with the really flavorful hot sauce it came with. Each order comes with 2 pieces, though I'd love for them to accommodate different party sizes by throwing in extra pieces for an extra charge so everyone at the table can have their own piece.\n\nFor those who like to try a little bit of everything, the Mercato platter is the one for you. It features chickpeas, stewed carrots, braised collards, simmered lentils, caramelized onions and cabbage, each with its own distinct flavor profile and texture. I decided to go all in one one, the special tibs, because I love the way seitan soaks up the flavor of everything you cook it in. It had an amazing texture, a nice amount of kick and an incredible amount of flavor from the zesty berbere sauce and onions it's cooked with.\n\nThey don't have a liquor license yet and don't allow BYOB, but they have an extensive menu of thoughtfully prepared mocktails, and sodas.

Also had the tirawmisu - very yummy vegan treat.', 'My friend had just flown in from Chicago to Crown Heights, and we were wandering the neighborhood for dinner when we stumbled upon this absolute gem. After walking up and down Franklin Avenue, we thought Ras looked the most inviting with its lovely outdoor seating area, replete with pretty greenery and white accents. Most importantly, it was in the shade.\n\nOur waitress was friendly and helpful, and recommended that we get the lentil sambusas when we asked which filling. She did tell us that the vegan sampler was only for 1, and that she recommended getting an entree as well. My friend and I were actually quite full with just the sambusas and the vegan sampler (and she hadn\'t eaten all day). They currently don\'t have their liquor license, but do have amazing mocktails. It\'s a plus for me since I don\'t drink :)\n\n+ Lentil sambusas ($8 for 2) - These were absolutely the best sambusas/samosas I\'ve ever had in my life. The mashed lentils were cooked with some spices and aromatics that rendered the texture a delightful contrast to the flaky pastry, and incredibly flavorful. I like this filling better than meat ones I\'ve had in the past. After one bite of this, I immediately thought ""I need to bring my vegetarian friends here."" The spicy sauce that accompanies it was also delicious with a lot of heat; we liked it so much that we saved it for our vegan sampler.\n\n+ Vegan sampler with injera ($19) - There\'s an option to get it with rice or injera, but I would always go with injera. It wasn\'t as sour as I would like, but it was still spongy and a great accompaniment to the food. This comes with shiro (ground chickpeas), gomen (braised collard greens with onions and tomato), missir (lentil stew with onions and berbere), fasolia (roasted string beans, onions and carrots), and yatakkilt alicha (sauteed cabbage, carrots and peppers). Our favorite by far was the fasolia - it was roasted and spiced addictively. I think I\'d get an entire entree of this next time, though it was really fun and delicious having a little bit of everything. I would definitely recommend the vegan sampler.\n\n+ Guava lemonade - I don\'t know how much it cost, but just put ""guava"" on a non-alcholic drink to guarantee that I\'ll get it.

I've been visiting here for over a year now and I am NEVER disappointed. My classic go-to's are the Milano, and a pellegrino (limonata). I usually prefer white sauce over any other sauce (pink, red) because of the creaminess. The milano comes with chicken, mushrooms, and white sauce; the perfect trifecta! Although, they are a tad pricey I feel like you are paying for the quality. The workers here are amazing as well, and I always get good service! I am definitely a customer for life, and can't wait to pick up my next steaming hot plate of yummy pasta."", 'Thanks a lot Michelle! We are very proud to say that we have the freshest pasta and ingredients and we cook everything per order. Thank you for noticing!\nWe truly want to thank you for your support always but most specially during these tough times. We hope to see you soon in our tables!

Yes we did takeout, yes it was delicious! Definitely We are going to order again! Seafood risotto, home made pasta , and truly delicious cheese cake with blueberry was highlight of the night. Looking forward to try more stuff from their menu."", 'Thanks Vita for such nice words!!! It’s never too late to try our food, you can alwsys make up for all these meals you missed! ;-)\nI don’t recall what you ordered but next time I would suggest, homemade papardelle with short rib ragu, homemade gnocchi with spicy sausage and broccoli rabe and tiramisu!', ""TL;DR: good food, great friendly staff, love that they provided hand sanitizer at the table\n\nMy fiancé and I were hungry after our hike and found this sweet spot in Bay Ridge. We always love homemade pasta so we checked it out.\n\nWe got the Prosciutto e Mozzarella - which was tasty followed by the Napoli - which is gnocchi with spicy sausage, mushrooms and pink sauce and the Venezia - which is fettuccine with shrimp, mushrooms and capers in a white wine sauce.\n\nI like the Napoli. It tasted homey and it was a delicious red sauce. The sausage and mushroom was delicious. The gnocchi was okay though. It felt a bit dense and doughy to me (and if that's how gnocchi is supposed to be, then completely disregard my comment). It wasn't bad though. I just wish it was just a tad less dense but that's just my opinion.\n\nThe Venezia was good. Clean white wine sauce. The shrimp was delicious and super plump. I did wish the white wine sauce had a little more flavor to it though. The fettuccine was great and you could tell it was home made.\n\nTo top it off, we got the tiramisu which was absolutely delicious. I'm a big fan of tiramisu so it's hard for me not to love it.\n\nOverall, good food and great staff. I would most likely come back again."", ""I am so incredibly impressed with the quality of food from Piccante!! All of the pastas are homemade and prepared to perfection, not too al dente but not too soft. I mean, who likes a limp noodle?! The Pasta Toscana is ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta and served in the most delightful brown butter sage sauce, which is personally one of my favorites, especially in the Fall. I highly recommend choosing this dish if you are looking for something unique, decadent, and delicious. The Rome Pasta is homemade rigatoni with beef bolognese, and they definitely provide an ample amount of beef in the sauce and it reminds me of home. I can always determine if the food is going to be on point if the traditional dishes are outstanding, and that they are!! The Lasagna is a beef lasagna with marinara sauce and bechamel, so it's not topped with mozzarella as one would expect but it was outstanding!! I actually brought this dish home and added a little ricotta to it because I'm obsessed with cheese (and perfectly okay with that, although my doctor-not so much). It was absolutely fantastic and I would highly recommend this dish as the ultimate comfort food!! Marta, the owner is a delight, so friendly, and so accommodating. This restaurant is one that should not be missed, and when you're in Bayridge, you MUST go and enjoy a meal that will leave you beyond satisfied and your wallet still full because it is extremely reasonably priced."", ""Not spectacular. Just ok. I wouldn't go back unfortunately.\nMy husband went in for an early dinner. The roasted pepper spread that came with the bread was delish. Calamari was delish. But main pasta dishes were not. I ordered venezia dish- flavorless. Mushrooms didnt taste at all fresh almost like they came out of a can. Husband ordered the Milano. Just ok. One of the best italian restaurants in bay ridge? That is a reach. I've definitely had better food."", 'Love this place..  Great food... Great service... One of my favorite places to eat in Brooklyn & Bay Ridge', ""A part of me almost doesn't want to write this review. I'm in love with this place and want to keep it under the radar, but more people need to know about Piccante! A couple of friends and I decided on this place for dinner on a Friday night. It's a cozy spot, definitely make a reservation. It has been years since I've been to Italy, but the flavors here reminded me of it. We ordered gnocchi, risotto, tomato and cream based pasta. I tried all of them and they were all so good!\n\nThe portions were just right and all my friends finished their food. I had to pack mine to go, but it was my fault for taking up stomach space with bread. They give you complimentary bread, which is served warm with their own dipping sauce (might not be to everyone's taste). The only thing is that It can get a little loud in there with everyone talking, but it wasn't terrible. I am definitely going to be back.

And this, my friends, is a place to come and worship.  The Boss--as this sandwich is so aptly named--is so rich and flavorful when you sink into that first bite, you wonder why they even bothered with a sauce dip on the side.  But it\'s there, and you get a little curious about that garlicy, buttery smell and give it a try out of curiosity, and... ahh.  Food heaven.\n\nI\'ve been able to tear myself away from The Boss a couple of times, enough to learn that their Breakfast ""All Damn Day"" options (a concept I wholeheartedly support) are fantastic--I particularly love the scrambled eggs (served with ham and plantain chips).  Their rice and beans are incredibly flavorful to start with, and incredible served with the optional three fried eggs on top.  And if you have room for dessert, the Nutella empanada is as amazing as it sounds.\n\nA takeaway stand to begin with, My Cuban Spot became one of my go-tos during the lockdown, as the only adjustment was standing a socially distant length apart from the throngs of others waiting outside this tiny, charming little hut, enjoying the incredible smells and waiting to grab some homemade Cuban goodness to go.', ""Wooooooow! Wooow! Woooooow!! The pork in this Cuban is so perfectly seasoned and moist, it's by far the best Cuban I could have had outside my own home EVER! I will forever be returning for a Cuban from here and to eventually try all the other goodies they offer.

We got The Boss sandwich and Oink Oink bowl. Food took a bit to come out but you could definitely tell that they were slammed with orders. And I know why, it's cause the flavors were on point and people need and want this food. We also got a Coke and it made everything better.\n\nThe food is great but definitely heavy and doesn't make you feel super healthy.

Never thought that I'd write a bad review of a small business during the pandemic, but this place is so arrogant that I think it needs to be acknowledged.\n\nNeither one of 3 employees were wearing a face covering inside their tiny space (obviously no social distancing). I get it, it's hot, but not wearing a face mask right now as you're taking orders from many many people and preparing food is unacceptable and illegal.\n\nThe blond woman taking the orders was EXTREMELY RUDE, like a hidden camera level rude. I literally thought they are shooting a TV show that wants to see people's reactions to someone cartoonishly awful to customers. I get it - she's busy, but I am not asking for a friendly chat (that would be an outrages thing to ask for from a cashier at a food stand!) I just want to be treated with civility.\n\nIt took very long to get the sandwich, so I had lots of time to watch the spectacle of the cashier's disgusting treatment of customers. Still shocked, just unbelievable.\n\nIt's a shame, really, because the sandwich was good. It doesn't matter however, because I will never return and will warn as many people as possible about the anti-mask, crazy rude service."", ""I'd really say a 3.5\n\nI ordered every sandwich, the beef empanada and the guava and cheese empanada.\n\nBy far, the one thing that is a must get (if you like desserts), is the guava and cheese empanada. It's filled to the brim and just absolutely delicious. I could buy a dozen and eat them in one sitting.\n\nNow on to rating the food in rank order\n1. Guava and cheese empanada (amazing)\n2. Beef empanada; also filled and good flavor, still crispy after a 30 min drive.\n3. Steak sandwich; flavor is great. How can you go wrong with steak and canalized onions\n4. Pork sandwich; flavor was solid and the pork was fairly juicy\n5. The fritz: which is really more like a sausage burger. Flavor was solid, burger was juicy, but not anything that really put it above the other items.\n6. The Cuban; this was disappointing to me. I have been looking forward to this sandwich for 7 months.  The pork was oddly dry in comparison to the pork sandwich. The main flavor I got from this was mustard, and nothing stood out about the sandwich.\n\nOverall; I would come back for that guava empanada. Maybe the steak sandwich."", ""I love this place!!! It's a little out of the way for me but I promise it is worth it! I came here with two friends and ordered the Cuban Sandwich, Oink Oink Babe Bowl, Flan and Tres leches cake. Everything was SO good. I highly recommend the Cuban Sandwich. The pork bowl was a just a biiit too salty and dry for me but it was still really good and worth it! Their desserts are really good too! Definitely check it out.

It is a must have if you are a fan of Cubano sandwich."", 'Had this for the first time and ordered the little piggie needs bread sandwich and a beef empanada.

Let me correct the errors.\n\nI kept going back and forth between a 3 or 4...I can't believe I just found this gem, and yes it is a hole in the wall.\nThe cons:\n- it was cold, no heated lamps, and 6 metal seats. Not a good combo for NY fall or winter weather. (The partner mentioned that they do have heated lamps but he wasn't prepared as the cold just sneaked up.) a little history the owner did replica of ventanitas such as those on Calle Ocho.\n- no ketchup\n- the fried plantains weren't fresh and some were stale\nThe pros:\n- each sandwich is made with a lot of detail and precise on a buttered toast Italian bread.  Yes it looks like a Italian bread but it's pan Cubano.  one slice of cheese, two slices of ham, one pickle, mustard and pernil...you guessed it this it their Cuban sandwich aka boss sandwich. The pernil was perfectly slow cooked, soft and juicy.\n- some bread and steak was delicious not as moist as the pernil but full of flavor.\n- tres leche was a decent size with extra cream (leche)\n- staff were friendly and food came out quickly\nI will de go back to try other dishes on the menu""]",,"['delivery', 'pickup']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/my-cuban-spot-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Ronnie and Henry are sooo welcoming & the food and drinks will have you automatically returning because each is that good. They're drink selection states they wouldn't serve anything they wouldn't drink &  I'm telling you honestly this is by far the best frozen margarita spot in my area (Bay Ridge/Sunset Park/Park Slope). If your like me, a foodie in your 40's I'm sure acid reflux is always lurking in the back of your mind  so when I try a margarita and don't get a  single case of heart burn for me that takes a prize. The homemade sour mix they use for their drinks is definitely the key to that statement. Don't just have the margarita, it's not Mexico's true traditional drink, try their Paloma, it's almost a silent creeper of a good time. The food  has a new modern twist of old traditional Mexican cooking techniques and new school modern Mexican appeal & flare  to it.

It was essentially oozy cheese and onions (forget if there's more - that's all I remember) but it was absolutely delicious, especially when you pair it up in a taco.\n\nThe guac was good. Nothing too special. Didn't blow me away but it was pretty standard guac.\n\nThey had a lot of seating. It seem like they were sharing the outdoor space with Crudo Bar, which was pretty smart.

With the challenges of COVID, we have really been missing our favorite places and were delighted to see they were opening for takeout. We finally called ahead to place our order for pick up.\nI ordered a Caesar salad appetizer, a porterhouse for 2, a side of green beans and mashed potatoes. I arrived with my own thermal bag but they did have everything nice and hot in a box- the food stayed perfectly fresh for my 10 minute walk home and as usual, the food is excellent. I am eating as we speak and felt the need to share this excellent experience.\nAs of today, they seem to have outdoor seating available by reservation only - We will MOST definitely be back for a dining al fresco experience.', ""For Brunch!\nCelebrated my anniversary with my husband and parents at DeStefano's for their new(ish) brunch service. The menu has a wonderful array of brunch classics like french toast, frittata, egg benedict, and hearty burgers.\nWe ordered their crab cakes (which are on the dinner menu) as an appetizer and these shall remain my favorite crab cakes ever. They come on a bed of a lightly dressed salad and an aioli dipping sauce on the side.  The spinach eggs my mother had came in a fluffy omelette that was huge and wonderful; it also came with a side of home fries that were soft and flavorful. My husband and father both ordered burgers that were massive and very tasty; the burgers came on a fluffy, pillowy bun with a side of crispy hand cut fries (i had potato envy).\nI ordered the eggs benedict and it was excellently executed. The hollandaise was creamy and balanced along with the perfectly poached eggs and a side of their home fries. Aside from having potato envy, it was wonderful.\nThe highlight, however, was the bright and refreshing sangria that they offer with their brunch. I shamelessly had 3 glasses.\nI am so happy that DeStefano's is offering brunch now! Moar brunch dates please!"", ""I love Brooklyn. Its my hometown. Its also where De Stefano's is located.\nYou can look all over Brooklyn for top quality steaks with top quality customer service to match but De Stefano's hits the nail on the head.\nOnce inside this family-run steakhouse, you are greeted by some great Brooklyn Memorabilia. A large reprint of the front page of a newspaper featuring the Brooklyn Dodgers, or pictures of Brooklyn Celebs- tons of Brooklyn Pride! Enter the dining room and behold the cozy atmosphere with tons of family photos from all generations covering the walls.\nGet comfy, because you are dining with the family tonight.\nAlong with their tasty steaks, are some really great chops! Veal, Lamb, and Pork. Fancy a little something different before your steak? De Stefano's has some thick and hearty soups to start with as well as some tasty crab cakes and lobster ravioli.\nThis place is not for the bird eaters. Come hungry.\nThe staff is always pleasant and the service has always been the best.\nMy most recent visit, John (one of the owners) took care of my boyfriend and I and recommended a wine for us that was absolute perfection- not to mention affordable.\nA favorite among us is the New York Strip Steak and the Veal Chop. Two meaty hunks of beef cooked to perfection- medium plus, please- and an order or two of some tasty sides.\nFor sides, I almost always order the garlic sauteed spinach and the green beans with proscuitto. Great sides!\nI am almost always too full for dessert but manage to finish dessert too. The tartufo, a vanilla, chocolate ice cream combo covered in a dark chocolate shell, was a great end to fantastic meal.\nThis is a great steakhouse that is family-run and offers customer service that makes the other local steakhouses pale in comparison.\nThe vibe here is totally casual so coming in your jeans and sneakers is okay- although I like to dress it up just a tiny bit."", ""My mom is now a seasoned Yelper thanks to her love for Deals. The Yelp deal she purchased for DeStefano's went to good use last week when my mother took us out for dinner. Us being myself, my brother, and my father. It was the first time in YEARS that we were dining as a complete family and what better place than this local family run restaurant?\nMom has been to DeStefano's before and always spoke of it with such fondness. I can see why now after having experienced it myself.\nJohn, the owner's son was ever helpful. He picked out a wine for us to enjoy that was as delicious as it was affordable. We decided to order two of the 40 oz Porterhouses (meant for two) and shared them among the 4 of us. We also ordered an individual side of  spinach and garlic, an individual side of glazed carrots, and a family size of the garlic mashed potatoes.\nThe Porterhouse, as they recommend, was served medium rare. I thought it was PERFECT. Although my family might have wanted theirs cooked a little more medium than rare. It was the perfect amount of seasoning and the perfect texture. So supple that I was able to cut my steak with my butter knife!\nI was in hog heaven!\nThe garlic mashed potatoes were definitely something to write home about! We tore up the platter of fluffy and garlicky mashed potatoes.\nThe spinach was a little on the salty side but still delicious. And the glazed carrots cooked with brown sugar and maple syrup smelled of dessert but needed a salty element, in my opninion.\nWe were handed dessert menus, but i was ready for a nap!\nA FANTASTIC dining experience a mere walking distance from my apartment. Can't wait to come back!"", ""I am so happy I read everyones good reviews and took a chance going to Destefano's.\nWe went for my mother's birthday and she loved it. The tables were more than 6feet apart beacuse of social distancing with Covid.  Everyone felt safe. The server was courteous and patient. We never felt rushed once eventhough we spent alot of time taking pictures!:) When our food finally arrived, we were in heaven!!! The food was like eating chocolate and feeling happy. We had the lamb chops, 16oz new york strip, chicken cordon bleau, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn and spinach. The drinks and cheese cake were great as well.\n\nOverall, it was worth the money."", 'This is one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants. The staff is always friendly and the food was always delicious.\n\nWe always feel carried for.', ""Pretty good! Service was faster than most steakhouses. BUT it wasn't better than Peter Luger's sorry :( But if you like meats seasoned with peppercorn then you may really enjoy their steaks!\n\nI would absolutely come back if Peter Lugers is full lol"", 'It is very likely that one might find themselves in Williamsburg to have a steak. However, where one thinks they can get the best steak in Williamsburg might differ from where the best steak actually is. DeStefano\'s is the spot you want to find for steak and several other meats.\n\nIn addition to various cuts of steak, DeStefano\'s has lamb chops, chicken cordon bleu, as well as some seafood options. There is also quite the selection of sides, all of which is very high quality. The staff is very friendly and inviting. Having been to DeStefano\'s several times, one of my favorite gimmicks is that they bring the customer a butter knife with the filet mignon and say that a steak knife is unnecessary, because they steak is so soft and tender. (They\'re correct, by the way.) It is a relatively small space, reservations are a good idea. The dining room is cozy and has a warm, almost parlor-like feel to it. They have a prix fixe menu that\'s a really good deal, if you\'re looking to save some money and still get a quality steak and some fixins\'.\n\nDuring the most recent visit to DeStefano\'s, I was set on ordering a filet mignon, but when I looked at the menu, I saw ""chicken cordon bleu"" and I went for it, I could be no happier with that decision. This chicken was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. Long story short, they do more than just steak really well.\n\nCurrently they have outdoor seating. They have both isolated booths for parties, as well as tables out in the open (under tents). They do take credit cards, a big plus if one is looking to rack up those points. The other place only takes cash and debit. As always, I feel it important to note when the restroom is spacious and/or clean, DeStefano\'s is both.\n\nI mention *the other place* only because it\'s the establishment. Everybody has heard of it, it\'s a draw, but is it really the best, or is it resting on its laurels? DeStefano\'s is likely a sleeper for many patrons. Bottom line is this: great steak, excellent variety of cuts, impressive variety of other entrées, and quality sides to round it all out.']",,['restaurant_reservation'],https://www.yelp.com/biz/destefanos-steakhouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

The art scene is dope but Bushwick also has a sick food game. Nicandra's is one of those small places that has blown my mind every time I've been. Their pastas are spectacular - like the actual pasta. It's never overcooked, always cooked just perfectly al dente. The sauces and flavors of their pasta? Also perfect. I'm not a huge fan of overly creamy pastas because true Italian pasta is definitely more nuanced.\n\nI've also had their appetizers (octopus & burrata) and I guess they just do everything right. Also a great great date spot. Make reservations ahead - it's a small place and fills up quickly. My personal favorites - their amuse bouchée, octopus, burrata, squid ink pasta, brown butter & sage pasta."", ""This place is definitely a hidden gem.

Oh man, oh man, this pasta dish took me by surprise in a good way. Those Calabrian chilis!!!! I love them so much!

We're both vegetarians, so my my bro had the Tofu Veggie with chickpeas in the coconut ginger broth with brown rice, I had the Veggie (which also has sauteed kale, mushrooms, and broccoli) minus the tofu, also in coconut ginger broth and brown rice, but with read beans.\n\nI have to say, we were both floored.  We were catching up on stuff, but half of every time I tried to talk my food kept calling back at me.  As we were sitting in the window seats (the place got packed really quickly) it did make my rudeness with chomping down my food mid-convo a bit easier, LOL.  The sorrel was also on point, which doesn't happen to often.  \n\nThe only complaint is that they didn't have any ice, which to me is an easy fix, but the drinks were cool upon serving.  \n\nBy time we left the place emptied out a bit and so we got to chat with the owner who is a very cool, personable guy. The staff is also on point, lending to my 5th star, which I do not easily dole out.  And the mark of a great meal for me is its heartiness...that you're satisfied for some time after. We ate close to 4pm but I wasn't really hungry again for the rest of the night.\n\nBeing born and raised in Brooklyn, Crown Heights and Lefferts Gardens were always two of my favorite neighborhoods, so I'm glad a spot like Food Sermon exists here."", ""Food Sermon was amazing! Yup, I had to start with that one-liner.\n\nMy Queen and I couldn't decide on a brunch spot, didn't wanna travel far, wanted to dine somewhere Black Owned, wanted Caribbean food.... etc. After more than a dozen searches we circled back to this spot on the yelp app. This place checked all the boxes on our list and happened to be a stone through from prospect park... double win.\n\nWe arrive at the restaurant and immediately notice the wooden table and benches, this gave off a very homey vibe and reminded me a lot of Trinidad. Upon entering the aroma welcomes you just as energetically as the staff does. We returned the greeting and ask for recommendations... of course, we inform the gentleman at the register (co-owner) that beef isn't an option so he suggested the chicken and fish. My Queen went with the crusted salmon over white rice, chickpeas, and the coconut (ginger I think) sauce. Mine was the jerk chicken over brown rice, red beans, and the tomato base. Both means were individually delicious, there was zero food envy at the table and the sorrels we bought were great additions.\n\nPersonally, the jerk bowl doesn't need anything... it was great by itself. The fish on the other hand, though delicious and balanced was slightly enhanced by the pepper sauce. Disclaimer!!! PEPPER SAUCE is NOT the same as HOT SAUCE, so don't use it the same way.\n\nAlso, be mindful of the wooden bench base as we had a shin incident that required some attention. This was quickly remedied by both the owners.\n\nFood: 5/5\nDrinks: 4.5/5\nLocation: 5/5\nAmbiance: 5/5\nService: 5/5\n\nSuggestion: Get the salmon as a starter and with each visit, try the other proteins to see which one suits you best.

It also came with a few pieces of super chewy and tasty sesame flatbread.\n\nWill definitely be ordering dinner here again in the future!"", ""I'm updating my review for two reasons: first of all, to mention the grilled calamari appetizer, which was simply delicious. Secondly, to commend the staff. I'm extremely bad around bees, wasps, really anything that stings, and it's one of the reasons I've been hesitant about outdoor dining because no matter what I order, wasps seem to find me. And sure enough, not 2 minutes after getting my lamb gyro, a stupid wasp started buzzing around my food. Staff came by and lit some Turkish coffee on fire so the smoke would drive away the wasps, which was honestly so nice of them and hugely appreciated :)"", ""Everything we ordered was delicious, the high reviews for this place are absolutely well deserved. Prices are pretty reasonable for Park Slope and the portions are enormous. I ordered the lahmacun, not really knowing what to expect and I'm so glad I did (lots of flavor, flatbread was perfectly thin and crispy, yummy all around). My dad ordered the mixed grill, which is a good option if you want to try several different types of meat. All were good but he liked the lamb gyro best (I tried a few slices and concur-- the lamb gyro meat was really well seasoned). Note: the lamb gyro doesn't come with pita bread but it did come with this really good white rice. I know what you're thinking-- how great can rice be, right? But it was like a better version of rice if that makes sense, just very soft and aromatic. My mom commented on it multiple times and let me tell you, she's pretty particular when it comes to rice. Also tried the babaganoush and lentil soup, both of which were well made. Don't think you can really go wrong with ordering here. Would definitely come back!"", 'This place is so good, wow. I got the falafel wrap aNd the stuffed grape leaves. Stuffed grape leaves were good, nothing TOO special. But the FALAFEL WRAP WAS SO GOOD! It has super fresh lettuce and pickled cabbage and humus and is huge, a really good portion. Best in the neighborhood.', ""Probably 3.5 stars for me, said on the heels of a trip to Istanbul.\n\nI came here because I was looking for the rare location in New York that serves vegetarian manti, in this case spinach. The only other place with this on the menu is in New Jersey, so I thought I'd start with Tava given the easier trip.\n\nThe manti themselves were not bad! The yogurt and tomato chili paste sauce was pretty good, but could have used a bit more oil, and was on the drier side. The manti themselves were tasty but a little bit too hard for my taste; I'd prefer them to melt in your mouth, fully doused in yogurt.\n\nThe mezze were just so-so. Babaganoush was very good, but hummus and others didn't leave a strong impression.\n\nThey don't have a wide selection of raki, but we did share a small carafe, which is the perfect accompaniment.""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tava-turkish-mediterranean-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Once you walk in you are immediately greeted by a window of treats and a plethora of sweet smells.\n\nFood/baked goods: Where to even begin...\n\nThey have a solid brunch menu with savory and sweet options. Being the savory breakfast person that I am, I ordered the Biscuit, which is a cheddar & chive biscuit, bacon, cheddar, sunny up egg, tomato jam and arugula. This was on par with my favorite biscuit sandwich from The Corner in Montclair. Everything about this sandwich was fantastic- from the thick bacon to the fluffy biscuit and the perfectly runny yolk of the egg. This was delicious and filling and only $11, which honestly is not bad at all for Brooklyn prices. My partner got the chorizo breakfast burrito and it was filled with copious amounts of really tasty chorizo (not too salty which is awesome) and fluffy af eggs. We also ordered the matcha latte and a regular latte. They have numerous dairy alternatives so we opted for oat milk. The lattes were super fresh and the matcha was super tasty.\n\nSo after brunch we ended up taking some baked goods to go, because obvs. We walked away with a lot because once you look at the case it's hard not to. Here's what we ended up with:\n\nOlive Oil Citrus Mini Loaf: My absolute favorite baked good from here. The cake is moist, has a nice hint of citrus, and it just all around tasty. If they made this into a full sized loaf I would have to tell them to hide it from me.\n\nCoconut Pandan Mochi: My fav second item. I love how the outer part of the mochi is crispy and has toasted coconut flakes, then inside is soft and chewy and has that perfect mochi texture. The pandan flavor is distinguishable from the coconut as well.\n\nUbe Mochi: Also solid, great Ube flavor\n\nSea Salt Chocolate Chip cookie: Dope, dope dope dope. Soft and chewy on the inside.\n\nChocolate Snickerdoodle: By far the sweeter cookie from the sea salt chocolate chip. Great cinnamon and chocolate flavoring blended together.\n\nI also walked away with an iced chai with oat milk. So freaking delightful, refreshing, and sweet!\n\nPrices are reasonable. To be fair we walked away with a ton so our tab was on the higher side, but for the quality and taste, it's all well worth it.\n\nService: Fantastic. I will always support badass women who run bad ass businesses. Take my money!\n\nSuper excited to come back and try more, including the cakes!"", ""We were totally in the mood for cakes and this was nearby so we gave it a shot. Cute, tiny place with about 5 two seater tables? Service was quick, easy and welcoming. We were really hoping to try a slice of cake that we saw on yelp but only had the Ceremonia cake available. We opted for the coconut pandan mochi and churro mochi dessert. Pandan had great balance of flavor and not being overly sweet. Churro mochi was different but not in a bad way. Price point is reasonable too. We'll be back for cake next time. Hope to see more Filipino/Asian flavors in the future!"", 'Wow, I cannot say enough nice things about this place!

To add to it we chatted with the program director and found out that the restaurant has an amazing program training refugees in culinary arts. Good food, good service, and good vision, that's a win in my book. We will be returning again for brunch and to try their dinner menu."", ""The refugee endeavor alone seems worthy of a 5 star review. Left a name and number during a wait, but was not called back. Luckily came back to check anyways, and tables were open.\n\nTidy presentation and proportions were just right by NY standards-not stuffed, not hungry. Nothing out of this world, just solid good food. Southern Grits were tasty..perfect eggs, tasty biscuit, and plain grits with a dab of butter, all of which was much enjoyed. The Nutella stuffed pancake wasn't really stuffed so much as wrapped, but the light frying of the pancake made it all decadently delicious w light whipped cream. And lastly, the Knafeh was buttery and pleasing...not cheesy as I had expected in a Knafeh, but still it was savored and devoured.\n\nLooking forward to trying more dishes, and perhaps even getting tickets to a graduation night when the graduating apprentice cooks dishes from his/her home country.

We made it in time to order some items off the happy hour menu, and thoroughly enjoyed our reduced price wings, meatballs, cheese plate, and house wines. The meatballs were served with crusty bread and a refreshing yogurt sauce. The cheese plate was small (just a piece of Brie, bread, mustard, honey, and some sort of nut brittle) but did the trick. The wings were incredibly flavorful with a tamarind BBQ coating. We also ordered the vegetable tagine, which was served with couscous and had a sweet, tangy flavor. The host went out of his way to offer dairy-free versions of dishes to accommodate our group, and the cozy restaurant atmosphere made for a great date night. Moreover, it felt great to support a restaurant that's doing such good. Go here!"", ""Came here this morning for breakfast as a party of 4, because my friend saw the menu online and wanted to check it out. The restaurant was very cute inside, with a farm to table atmosphere, and after chatting with our waiter, we found out that the restaurant hires a couple of people every 3 months as party of a culinary school. Everyone hired is either a refuge, someone who is seeking asylum, or broke out of human trafficking. He said that everyone starts out in meal prep, working their way up, and then graduates from the program, and so far everyone has gone on to find a job in a restaurant afterwards. I love this, and I would 100% support a restaurant like this if there was one close to my home.\n\nIt wasn't just because of all of that, that I'm leaving a 5 star review either. The waiter and the hostess were so friendly, and all of the food was so good and the fruit with the pancakes and waffles tasted so fresh.

There were blue crabs, gulf shrimps, oysters, okra and steamed rice in the gumbo.

The sauce was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this! The portion is good too.\n\nBarbequed Shrimp ($22.00): It is kind of pricey for 6 shrimps but it is worth it! The shrimps are high and the Worcestershire butter sauce is to die for! It comes with a side of bread for you to dip in the sauce.

I went with the bar because I wanted a relaxed vibe to enjoy my red wine and dinner.\n\nI had their petite lettuce and herb salad, which was extremely delicious (coming from a girl who doesn't love salads that much)! It was herby and had a few crunchy nuts in there, which I loved. The dressing was to die for--whatever it was! My friend ordered some clams for his appetizer which he devoured. For our entree, I had the crawfish etouffee and my friend had the seafood gumbo. We tried a bit of each other's food and he loved my etouffee way more than his gumbo because of the heavy Creole seasoning my dish had. I was also a huge fan of what I ordered.

This bar actually serves dinner-size portions of delicious, quality food. Always a win when my booze-sponging options aren't just limited to wings and fries. The chili cheese toast was fine but forgettable, and the Laotian sausage was pretty good, but the steak salad was exceptional. It had those wonderfully marinated tangy and spicy flavors reminiscent of Thai/Laotian cuisine. My friends got the steak frites, and the fries came with a side of fish sauce mayo that was AMAZING. Why did I never think of this winning combo before, and how can I ever go back to ketchup now?\n\nAs for cocktails, I got the Hot Buttered Rum, which tasted stronger and not as sweet as I would've liked, but still got me feeling nice and toasty.

It comes from the sanskrit word meaning ""equal"" and it encompasses uniformity as well as having consideration towards all human beings, etc. It is so cool that the owners chose this to be included in the name of their establishment known as Sama Street. It is a lovely sentiment that seemed to be shared/displayed throughout our dining experience.\n\nThe three of us decided to meet up at Sama Street on a recent Saturday evening for dinner. Once I came through the front door, I was delighted to see that Sama Street has a club / lounge vibe. Candles lit and beautiful lightning, comfortable looking couches/ lounge chairs in the back area, chich seating with dining tables + by the bar area....Sama Street is definitely elegant while maintaining a down-to-earth vibe.\n\nWe were excited to eat as we saw interesting  things on the menu. Sama Street serves Asian-inspired small plates as well as entrees on their ""specials"" menu. Two of us decided to get Steak Frites w/ French Fries which is one of Sama Street\'s entrees. One of us opted to have Steak Salad - Gochujang marinade, popped tamaki,mint, cilantro, shallots, dried chili + Loation Sausage - Lemongrass and herb pork sausage w/ charred tomato and puya chili relish. The marinated steak and sausage + seasoned french fries were marvelous.\n\nSpeaking of cocktails....There is an extensive enough list of cocktails on the menu including several ""Fall/Winter Season"" Specials like Hot Buttered Rum and Cider. My ""Red Rhino"" - Rye, Amontillado Sherry, Lime, Mint, Spiced Cranberry Compote and Nicole\'s ""Primal Instinct"" - Rye, aged rum, tepache, pineapple gum +.smoke were really good.

Each side was distinctive in taste and richly flavorful. We even had some extra injera and sides leftover for the next day's lunch. Despite the less-than-ideal delivery format, the food was a hit.

Basically, she laid down the injera and then made two piles of each of the nine dishes. When you order as take-out, everything is given to you in a large pizza box, so this was our canvas.\n\nSo, everything was good. However, I wasn\'t as BLOWN AWAY, as I feel like everyone else is about this place. Injera is whatever. It\'s spongy and I found it a little acidic tasting? The lentils in the Misir Wot and Yater Kik Alicha were a little hard for my taste (however, the flavor of the Misir Wot was delicious!). Maybe this is just how Ethiopians cook their lentils, but I prefer them a little softer. That being said, I really enjoyed the Butecha Selata, a limey kale salad with dried cranberries and what looked like a crumbly cheese, but because vegan, I assume was the ""butecha."" Additionally, I was a big fan of their seasonal dish--a saucy green beans thing (sorry for the uselessness of that).\n\nWe also ordered a tea. I have no idea which one because when we called to place the order, my roommate just said ""tea"" and then ""iced tea"" and we got what we got. There was definitely hints of cardamom (my favorite) and ginger in it; plus, it was sweet, so my guess is the Ethiopiano. Highly recommend.\n\nAnyway, good place.

Waitress A offered to replace it with another dish, which was delicious but then she brought the (salvaged) gnudi back out after having claimed it was ""thrown away"".

I always wanted to write a review for this amazing place but never got to it until now.\n\nI had the No. 1 and it was probably the best pizza I ever had in NYC aside from DiFara. Tasty, savory, light. Though one could argue you can't compare it to a classic New York slice since this particular pizza doesn't use a tomato-based sauce. Couldn't stop eating it. I would come back to try every one of their pizza specials if I could.\n\nAlso, though I literally just walked into their restaurant to pick up my takeout pizza, just from my few interactions I could tell you that their service is amazing."", ""This place was amazing! I read how difficult it was to get a table, I came in as soon as they opened and there were about 4 different parties that had the same idea!\n\nThey are fully following Covid guidelines and have indoor and outdoor seating.\nThe service was fast; the only upsetting thing was that their menu was limited when I visited and, they didn't have everything I wanted to order which means I have to come back!"", ""As amazing as everyone says and definitely worth the wait!\n\nPrior to Covid, we came on a weekend for a late lunch (around 2pm), where we (unsurprisingly) found a line out the door, which moved fairly quickly. The waiting process was very organized with someone from the restaurant directing the traffic in and out the doors.\n\nUsually you're only able to do half pies of the classics (margherita, marinara, white, calzone), but we asked if we could do two half pies of the margherita and the no. 4, and our waiter was kind enough to make it happen! As a note though, we were charged for price of the full, more expensive pizza, which made sense. Between two people a medium size was plenty, and you could definitely taste the freshness of the ingredients and the handiwork of the dough. Would be happy to come back the next time I'm in NYC!"", 'Omg their pizza and calzones are phenomenal!! The pizza was super light and crispy. No soggy bottoms here! The crust has a delicious crunch to it and the cheese is unbelievable! We had a drive to Jersey, so I recommend eating in car if you want the full experience!\n\nParking is very difficult in this area. I suggest going with another person and having them wait in the car so someone can run in and grab the food!', 'I admit it, New Yorkers are a finicky bunch.  We\'re proud of our pizza.  Some of us are willing to wait in line for hours for that perfect slice or NYC\'s ""best"" hot pastrami sandwich, bowl of ramen, or bagel. If there\'s a silver lining to be found in the COVID pandemic, lots of popular restaurants are offering pick-up and delivery where none was previously available.\n\nJuliana\'s has been offering such services, sans that annoying Seamless delivery fee we have all come to hate during a time when we are (more or less) prisoners in our own home.  Fulfilled through Toast (or call up the old fashioned way), you can have a pie delivered to your home in about an hour!  \n\n*Cue Progressive Insurance*\n""We can\'t protect you from becoming your parents""\n\nOverall, this place lives up to the hype.  It was good, but definitely not so good as to justify the egregious in-person wait times.  Blame the tourists!  Another popular NYC pastime.\n\nWe ordered a large margherita pie topped with sausage & fennel.  The crust was perfect - thin and buttery, with the right amount of crunch.  The marinara sauce was a bit unbalanced.  Too sweet for our tastes, but still really solid.  We were disappointed with the sausage & fennel add-on.  They were not only stingy on toppings portion size, but the sausage & fennel flavors were uninspired and bland.  The pie portion size was also a bit lacking, so adjust your order accordingly.\n\nThis is not your classic NY slice.  It\'s dainty food or as the food aficionados like to say, ""elevated cuisine.""  I\'m glad we had the opportunity to try this famous spot (and you should try it at least once too!).  However, we\'re unlikely to become repeat customers.', 'I\'ve been a fan of New York pizza since way, WAY back in the Day. Whenever I\'m in NYC I never fail to avail myself of both old favorites and ""legends about to happen"".  It\'s the prospect of the latter that brought me to Juliana\'s.  It\'s my understanding that Patsy Grimaldi, the legendary founder of the Grimaldi\'s pizza chain, founded Juliana\'s in 2012 (the year after he sold his original franchises to restaurateur Frank Ciolli).  In 2015 Trip Advisor rated Juliana\'s Pizza the best pizzeria in the US.  Add to this the fact that Juliana\'s Yelp reviews are in the stratosphere, and my expectations were quite high.\n\nI\'ve been to both the original Grimaldi\'s (just a stone\'s throw from this location) as well as several of Grimaldi\'s franchise locations in California and Las Vegas. Their pizza has always has a special place in my heart, so I was really looking forward to trying Juliana\'s!\n\nMy first (and probably last) visit to Juliana\'s was in 2019.  There were lines around the block, but we patiently waited to be seated inside (remember when surgical masks were for hospitals and virtually all restaurants had indoor seating?)  My friend and I decided to go with one of their special pies (#4 - with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto (italian ham), and arugula).  The price for a large was $32.\n\nOur pie arrived after a delay of around 30 minutes (to say the restaurant was packed would be like saying that Donald Trump has been known to use Twitter ;-)) and it was decidedly underwhelming.  The dough was soggy and bland, the toppings were skimpily applied, and the overall taste profile was reminiscent of a Domino\'s pizza that had been on the delivery truck for half of the night...\n\nNeedless to say, given the sub-par quality of the pizza here, the prices are several orders of magnitude higher than they should be.  \n\nJuliana\'s is one and done for me, and I can\'t recommend it to anyone who isn\'t seeking to replicate their first Domino\'s pizza delivery experience ;-)', ""I was planning to Grimaldi's next door but they opened an hour after Juliana's and we were hungry. There was a line at 3:45 waiting for their afternoon service. We luckily were able to cop one of the last tables outside.\n\nGot the number no4 pizza and boy was it disappointing. The pizza was tasteless, slightly cardboard-y, and cold. Coming from the far lands of Manhattan, I was really hyped to have the infamous Brooklyn pizza. I'm glad I didn't have to wait long lines for it. Actually, I think the pizza itself was ~ok but the price makes it nowhere worth it. The heated leftovers were better than eating it fresh, but that's because I had lower expectations, eating in my pjs vs at a restaurant. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here again."", ""Where do I begin.\nCrust wasn't too doughy, pepperoni wasn't too salty, pie was just thin enough and for those lactose intolerant people...it wasn't TOOOOOO cheesy. I know Brooklyn has a lot of pizza places but I would definitely recommend you to try this place!"", ""This is my favorite pizza in Brooklyn. If not, in all of New York City. Every time I'm in Dumbo I stop by for a pie. It's a MUST. I encourage you to call in advance for a reservation, because it does get super busy at times. It's worth the wait  \n\nPizza, meatballs and salads are fantastic!! I always ask for a side of extra marinara sauce to dip the crust. Makes it that much better!!"", 'How often do you get to see the man that started it all when visiting an old pizza place?! We had amazing Margherita and pepperoni pizza and a side order of meatballs.

Fried chicken absolutely lives up to the hype-- One of the best I've ever had in NYC, with delicious fresh toppings and condiments, and unusually for a fried chicken sandwich, it held up really well in transit. So did the nicely seasoned waffle fries. The falafel is not the familiar wrap filled with falafel balls and salad if that's what you're expecting; it's wrapped with a savory mix of veggies including sautéed onions and peppers, which were a really nice touch, all in an excellent chewy spinach wrap.

Her toast looked really crispy (toasted well) with a nice crunch sound when she took a bite. Looked very healthy and refreshing (because of the tomatoes). My fried chicken sandwich (on a brioche bun) was big and pretty good but not as healthy as her meal. I picked it because it had a brussel sprout coleslaw (which is different from normal coleslaw) and I was interested in their homemade plum chipotle sauce and homemade potato chips.

It's always very disappointing.\n\nBut fear not! My only dilemma, which I debated fiercely with my dining companion, was which sandwich was more perfect. I'd probably go with the lamb sandwich because it's a more unique offering, and this one is certainly the best I've ever had (but I also haven't had many). I could also make an argument for the chicken sandwich, which, while STILL is the best I've ever had, is way more common.\n\nIn any case, you can't lose.

It's not really done. I've been a customer of Ciao, Gloria since they opened and the owner has always been very nice to me and other customers. I've never once seen him be rude to anyone. Ever. Right now, during Covid 19, small businesses are really struggling. Most have been closed for several months and had to lay off their staff, plus cope with not being able to pay their rent, suppliers, and other expenses. I think now is the time to support them, and perhaps next time you might consider actually buying something from the bakery to use their tables (they have excellent pastries and beverages)!"", 'Wednesday morning coffee for 1.\n\nAfter biking a loop around Prospect Park, I decided to treat myself for an oat milk latte before heading back to work from home. There was only one person ahead of me waiting inside near the counter waiting for his drink. I waited for a few moments before entering, reading the sign on the door that said ""If you see people on the ramp inside, please wait outside until it\'s empty."" to regulate the traffic inside.\n\nThe barista was very friendly and made me a delicious coffee. I LOVED the interior of the cafe and the outdoor seating area with their branded blue chairs. The chairs and tables were SO CLEAN (and maybe new) -- which I\'m always so grateful for as to not have to clean up after someone\'s mess.\n\nI\'ll be back to try the matcha latte.', ""There aren't a lot of spots (at least, near where I live) that are serving breakfast these days, and some are even closed on Mondays. As I searched and searched for a b'fast location, I stumbled upon Ciao, Gloria. There's outdoor seating, umbrellas for coverage and you'll order takeout inside -- where the service is great and fast!\n\nMy friend loved her BEC, and I opted for the folded eggs breakfast. Ok, where did they get that incredible bread? It was literal perfection. I drowned it in the butter they provided, loaded up the eggs and avocado and was very content. The Chai Latte was also pretty great.\n\nIt's nice to have a b'fast meet-up with a friend, and to soak up the good weather while one still can."", ""Amazing spot for breakfast and lunch. The space is beautiful and accommodating and the food is so delicious. I come here as often as I can. Nutella croissant, PEC, Ricotta toast and any bundt are all must haves.\n\nMajor Update: they've added outside seating for customers!!!"", 'Amazing spot for breakfast and lunch.

Nutella croissant, PEC, Ricotta toast and any bundt are all must haves.', ""Every time I come here I swear I'm going to try something new but they make my favorite sandwich in Brooklyn, THE AVEC, and its never the wrong choice. Still touring the deserts, with the oatmeal creme pie cookies and nutella rice krispie bars in the lead for now. The space is well designed, with a great patio, and the staff is always welcoming and helpful. Love this place."", ""The day I tried pastries from Baked, my tastebuds were blessed. I have loved every moist cake, buttery cookie, and all the not-too-sweet frosting that has passed my lips from that bakery. So it was with great anticipation that I learned the same team would be opening an all day cafe in an airy Prospect Heights space, giving me even more reasons to visit this painfully charming neighborhood.\n\nI am pretty impressed with the restraint I exercised on my visit, because cinnamon rolls, cookies, and tortes gleamed in the pastry case, and it is a rare occasion that I resist a good pastry case. My savory inclinations got the best of me and I instead got a salty ricotta toast. They've got aesthetics here down pat because it almost seems as though the beautiful dishes were made to be photographed on their bright blue tables. Probably, actually.\n\nThe whipped ricotta was simultaneously airy and rich, made even more delicious with a smattering of chili sauce, which tasted like it was made in house. The sourdough bread it came on was very fresh, and sturdy enough to carry the generous spread of ricotta. I wish they had sharper knives though, because the dull metal knives provided did not help me cut through the bread at all, and my dining companion was faced with the same conundrum when she tried to cut into her avocado toast. We failed to eat our toasts as gracefully as this beautiful cafe warranted. Try eating your toast with dull knives, it ain't cute.\n\nI can't wait to return to let my sweet tooth get the best of me."", 'OMG!  Tiny little angels are flying over the bakery case at Ciao Gloria.  The first day we stopped in, there was absolutely no place to sit.  We tried waiting, but coffee shop culture had people imbedded at their tables on laptops, with NO sign of leaving.\n\nSo...we decided to get a pistachio croissant and a lemon square and shared them while walking back down the cold street, looking for another place to visit for awhile.  \n\nWe were all struck by the artistry and intention of these baked goods.  The pistachio croissant was exquisite, perfectly flaky and filled with an exceptional pistachio filling.  \nThe lemon square took everything good about this ubiquitous treat, and stretched and pulled it into something with a buttery, nut crust and a top layer that had the perfect balance of sweet and sour lemon.  Yes, the pastries here are that good!\n\nThe next day, we decided to return, this time to stock up a few specialties for a road trip.  While we had no intention of sitting, I was still curious to see if there were any seats available, and...there were not.\nI really do understand this is coffee culture and not Ciao Gloria\'s fault, but somethings gotta give.  The days of ""lets meet for coffee"" for a 30 minute sit down to catch up with a friend, seem to be a thing of the past.\n\nSO...YES YES YES, head directly over to CG for some elevated baked goods, go with the intention of take-out, and who knows, you might get lucky and score a seat!', ""Loved everything about my trip to Ciao, Gloria this morning! It is such a beautiful space: very colorful, chic, bright, modern, and cozy. Perfect space to have a bite with friends, to get work done, or for a family outing. While there's not plenty of seating, it's just enough to come with a group of up to 4 and feel comfortable.\n\nI came for breakfast on a Saturday morning. My best friend and I got here at 9am which was the right move because around 10:00am, the traffic started to pick up. The table we chose was towards the back and the sun was beaming down so brightly through their floor-to-ceiling windows, which was just what we needed on a super cold, windy day.\n\nMy bestie ordered their croissant, avocado toast, and chai latte. I had the avocado toast, turmeric latte, and also a vegan oats/banana muffin to go. My friend thought that the plain croissant may have the best croissant she's had in life. She even ordered two to go for her mom and husband so they could be in on the deliciousness!\n\nThe staff were very friendly and accommodating. They were attentive and checked in on us which made us feel good. We had an amazing Saturday morning at Ciao, Gloria and look forward to returning again soon!

I also got some potato dish that possibly had curry or tumeric in it, cauliflower that had potatoes and other stuff -insert shoulder shrug- and a roti-like option they had. The portions are a bit small if you're on a traditional American standard diet. The eggplant Parmesan and roti thing I got were both dense so I had some of my sides to take home to compliment my dinner.\n\nI was told I could go on Facebook and see what being offered each day- no too helpful for a person that needs to see what it is. I think some labels on the glass would be helpful so patrons could know what it is. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I would imagine that would be helpful so you don't order something that looked like it was ok for your diet and then it turns out it isn't. Also it would be helpful if the signs they have posted about the cost specifically states what was and was not included. Samosas NOT INCLUDED. Cupcake NOT INCLUDED.\n\nI don't know if I'll go back here with so many places in the area where I could spend $11 and know what I'm getting."", 'I have officially died and gone to heaven. Wow, what a lunch! It was my first time here as I was working in the area and I got the complete meal with 6 different dishes + dal and drink, all for $12. I mean...\nEach and every bite was delicious beyond what words can express. No greasiness, heaviness, saltiness, over sweetness... just a well balanced meal that featured and respected the real flavors of the food. Yeah, I will go out of my way to come here. What a find!', ""Well, you don't go for the ambiance. It's in the basement of a temple that frequently has a vagrant or two resting outside of it.\n\nWhat we go for is a hearty, reasonably-priced ($13), fresh, vegetarian lunch. We also go to support the institution that is always so welcoming and polite to its guests.\n\nTheir menu rotates by the day of the week. I think I've tried all five meal, but might have missed one day. All have been tasty.

The drumsticks were moist, however, the winglets were dry. I'm assuming because they cooked it on the same temperature for the same amount of time. The stir fried udon with beef was my favorite dish. It was simple but seasoned well and served on a sizzling plate. My second favorite item was the Samgyupsal which is the bbq pork belly, it was the right about of sweetness and served on a bed of onions so the pork belly would not burn and gives it an amazing taste. The kalbi was not marinated enough so it lacked a little bit of flavor.

We also got two orders of seafood pancake. They were crispy and not over cooked. Some Korean places who serve this make it way too doughy by adding too much flour, that's when you know you're at a non authentic Korean restaurant. The doiboki was a nice chewy consistency. What I didn't really enjoy was the sauce. It was kind of runny and too watery IMO but just my preference.\n\nThe bibimpap was also delicious.

Not to mention you wrote an equally ""essay long"" (and frankly nasty) response.\n\nYou have absolutely no idea what I have and haven\'t ordered from your restaurant in the past so I really don\'t understand the little digs at the fact that ""out of 30+ menu items"" I chose to order the chicken and fries that YOU offer on YOUR menu. I\'ve tried other items but found those to be standout choices which is why I\'ve ordered them multiple times.\n\n""I find it very funny"" myself that even in my ""offensive"" review (which despite your personal feelings, was true & honest based on the quality of food I received and was the reason I received a partial refund from Seamless after submitting photo evidence - as it also did not match what was expected from your photos on the platform), that I still took time to rave about your food (I\'ve actually left a 5-star review before). Or did you miss the ""crying in happiness level of good"" ""best chicken I ever put in my mouth"" ""good enough to take an uber roundtrip for"" (which was more than the cost of the food itself) parts?\n\nAlso ""very funny"" is that you still somehow validated everything I said. So you HAVE changed your cooking method, changed the way the food is served, and overall applied less concern to old items in order to add new items (all your words). Ok, cool - I suspected there was a change. So what was the purpose of your response then?\n\nOther restaurants have been able to put out the same quality of food as they did pre-covid. If they can\'t, then the item is simply excluded from the menu, so not sure what excuse you\'re trying to rely on there. I say this with firsthand experience as I\'ve ordered fairly consistently through the pandemic to support the industry - and there has been no difference anywhere.\n\nIf you think I will ever be returning to ""try other items"" after that level of response, you are laughably mistaken.

The truffle fries were completely unremarkable - not the amazing explosion of truffle oil & salt like in the past. The boneless fried chicken was a JOKE. There was no sauce on the chicken (what the actual hell?!). When I opened the box, I actually thought I got sent calamari. Digging in the bag I saw a TINY container of what I guess is supposed to be soy garlic ""sauce"" which A) was ridiculously small for the amount of chicken and B) Is liquid-y, watery and disgusting. Not the thick, savory sticky soy garlic sauce that usually the chicken usually came IN. It\'s so watery it doesn\'t even stick to the chicken when I attempted to use it as a dipping sauce.\n\nI was worried when I saw a review saying that they believe they changed the chef. I\'m sad to realize that they were probably right. I\'m surprised that during this time when restaurants are shutting down left & right, there are still places out here selling subpar food. Your customer base is already more than halved due to covid, yet you can\'t even double down and make sure that the few patrons you have left are at least getting food worth eating & coming back for.\n\nI\'m pissed because I just took 30 mins out of my day and 2 Ubers to go pick up my order (THAT\'S how good their food used to be) and received this box of crap.\n\nIf you\'re considering ordering from here because of the stellar yelp reviews, move along - that place and that food no longer exists.', ""When I was headed there I was under the impression that I was going to sit outside and enjoy my food.

In a word, excellent.\n\nTheir little cafe is perfectly Brooklyn: small and quaint, with a hipster vibe and a lot of community love. It is an ideal spot for a good book / laptop action and a quality caffeinated beverage. They have a cute outdoor setup as well, fun decor, and up until last year, would host everything from live music to poetry.\n\nWhere does one even begin with their variety of kolaches? The majority of them are more akin to the delicate pastries of their Czech / Central European roots, more so than the meat bun, oversized pigs in a blanket a la Shipley's of Texas variety. Both the sweet and savory batches have a flakiness and airiness that is a testament to the high quality ingredients that they use.\n\nMost of the sweet kolaches run for about $3.50. I am a sucker for the poppyseed, PB&J, candied pecan, and blueberry sweet cheese kolaches. The pricier savory ones are in the $4.50-4.75 range and my favorites include their ham and cheddar, bacon egg & cheese, jalapeno sausage and cheese, and even the spinach and feta. The only one I could spot without cheese was the regular Texas beef sausage, which was juicy and wonderful fresh out of the oven.\n\nI also have to give props to their coffee, which is via Kitten Coffee (#2) and the overall lineup of drinks.

I and my wife usually order a whole lot of quantity as normal two entrees are not sufficient whenever we dine out in any establishment that serve food. Portion is ok here however their sauce or seasoning for any entree they dish out are definitely on the bland side. I am always looking to spice things up with an alternative seasoning. Tartare is only meh especially even as far as to doubt if they are fresh or not, imo. On the brunch side their chicken and waffle dish was truly boring and not savory at all that I did not even clean the plate which I rarely ever do when I pay for my food. Their greetings are just robotic as if they couldn't be bothered to do any more than bare minimum which is kinda disappointing as this joint seems to be focused on the quality of food and given its cozy and intimate setting you would think they would have more personal interaction with their customers during dinner service. As a side note be careful when u need to go to the restroom as the path leading up to it is dimly lit covered by small drape and you can trip and fall as it is on one step above the restaurant floor especially if you had one too many.

The shrimp and grits had chorizo in it which was a nice touch and the burger had bacon jam which was another nice addition.\n\nThe one and only semi con that I would say is that the food is heavy which may or not be a con for someone else.

My concerns were quickly assuaged when Julio sat us down at our table, where a personalized menu was waiting for us with anniversary congratulations!

We hope that you will visit us again soon.\nBest,\nLagman House', 'Ever heard of Dungan cuisine? Me neither ... but after finally visiting Lagman House, I hopped right on Wikipedia and educated myself about it during my meal and afterwards.\n\nEver since they opened and took over the space of an Azerbaijanian restaurant, I was fascinated by their opening, not because they were some foodie hotspot, but because there was Chinese lettering on their awning. It\'s no secret that Sheepshead Bay is a predominantly Russian neighborhood, but other than Avenue U, there are basically no traces of any legitimate Chinese restaurants around (sorry Top China and Asian Bay). Little did I know, and an FYI to everyone else, but the Dungan people are of the former Soviet Union still, however have Chinese influences in their culture, which explains the lettering.\n\nWe dropped in on a quiet Friday evening at 6pm and, well, the restaurant was pretty quiet, except for the EDM music playing from their flat screen TV. Honestly, I prefer a restaurant to have a little white noise, but the EDM music was a bit odd, yet somehow soothing to the ears. In total, maybe 4 customers had come in throughout the 1 hour we were there. Lagman House is the perfect example of never judge a good restaurant by the number of customers.\n\nWe had done our research on what to order prior to our visit, although there wasn\'t much to work with in terms of Yelp photos. The menu consisted of a large section on salads, appetizers (hot and cold), soups, noodles (hot and cold), hot dishes and desserts. Based on reviews, noodles and manti (a fancy word for dumplings) were THE go-to foods here, so that\'s pretty much what we ordered:\n\nSTEAMED BEEF AND CHIVE MANTI\nPUMPKIN STEAMED MANTI\n- If I had to describe them, they were basically large, deflated dumplings, which came in a steam basket. Yeah, it doesn\'t sound appetizing, but don\'t judge their flavor based on my over-simplistic description. Served with a side of sour cream for your dipping pleasure, these large dumplings were quite delicious and enjoyable. I\'m a more salty, than sweet person, so I enjoyed the beef and chive manti more than the pumpkin. However, the pumpkin ones had a big fan in my wife and I can\'t knock them because they were still very tasty.\n\nCLASSIC LAMIAN\nHand pulled noodles topped w/ braised beef and onions\n- The only hand pulled noodles I ever had were all from Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or Flushing, but it was refreshing to see a restaurant make them in Sheepshead Bay. These noodles looked plain Jane on the outside, but each bite had a distinct lightness to it. There wasn\'t overpowering flavor to it, but enough to wake up your taste buds. Shockingly, a winner. Like I said, one look at it will make you go, ""Can I add some salt?"", but one taste and you\'ll go, ""I\'ll have more of that"".\n\nTSOMIAN\nStir-fried noodles w/ beef and vegetables\n- Boy, if there ever was a replica of a stir-fried lo mein this would be it! By no means was that an insult. In fact, this was the best dish of our evening. If anyone has been to a Shanghainese restaurant and ordered a stir-fried noodle from them, then you\'ll be very familiar with the flavors here. It was almost the same in every way, but still so damn good.\n\nThis little restaurant off of Sheepshead Bay Road isn\'t a huge draw and that\'s because of location, location, location. It\'s basically located all by it\'s lonesome self next to the library. Yeah, it sounds sad and like a dead end for a restaurant, but the food is quite good and delicious and that will hopefully help to sustain this local business. You don\'t have to listen to me, but they were recently featured in the NY Times, and if my opinion doesn\'t count something, there\'s should, so go check them out!', 'Thank you for the detailed review, Chris!

We smelled this dish as it was delivered to the table next to us and had to have it ourselves. No regrets.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the sushi and sashimi combo. When it arrived, I knew it was going to surpass my expectations, just based off appearance. The sashimi was cleanly sliced; the fish was perfectly portioned; and all of it looked fresh. Nothing was slimy. Everything was the perfect temperature. I hadn't eaten sushi this good since I lived in Japan. And it was truly prepared traditionally, including the wasabi under each slice of fish on the nigiri. If you're not a wasabi fan, take note.

For appetizers, I got the yellowtail carpaccio and maguro avocado. Both of which were flavored well and smooth to the mouth. The sashimi dinner had an assortment of different fish. They were sliced nicely and not too thick. The fish was so smooth and practically melted in my mouth. I also got the ki roll, fancy roll, and tamago. Everything had top quality fish and even the tamago was tastier than anywhere else I've tried. It was soft yet held together and seasoned slightly. Other entrees I tried were the kamo soba and the grilled spicy miso sea bass. The soba was very light in flavor and refreshing. The sea bass was delicious. It's not spicy at all and had a perfect crisp on top. It sits on top a bed of vegetables that soaked up the tasty sauce that it's cooked in.\n\nOverall, come here for tasty, authentic sushi.

My date had the Miso soup, and the Pink Lady Roll which consisted of salmon tempura, yellowtail, tuna avocado & masago roll in a pink...yes pink soy paper!! we decided on wine and settled on plum wine.\n\nAs the food came out, it was a beautiful sight to see. The plating for the rolls was amazing! Being place on a Japanese traditional rectangular plate with the rolls on top of a bamboo leaf. I didn't want to touch my meal as it was just so eye pleasing. As I took my chopsticks and tasted one of my rolls I knew it was not long before my plate would be empty. The flavors of all the ingredients meshed together yet tasting each one. The yuzu tobiko (flying fish roe) definitely added an extra flair to the taste.\n\nThe pink lady was said to have an interesting taste although might not be eye catching with the pink paper wrapping. The Miso soup however, was said to be pleasingly tasteful with all natural ingredients. As far as our wine it was delicious, being sweet and strong.

I had asked for medium spice, which turned out to be a little more mild than expected but still a tad spicy nonetheless which made the noodles so good. Excellent ""wok hay,"" which is how the Chinese describe that char-like aroma from a solid wok stir-fry.\n\n- TFK Pad Thai ($16) - Topped with calamari though?? How unique! Even though it wasn\'t crispy by the time we ate it, I love the idea and it was still delicious of course. Shrimps were nice and big - at least 5 of them per order. Overall generous portion size, with plenty to go around and made for great leftovers.\n\n- Bamee Haeng Kai Sab ($10) - from their ""Fight COVID menu"" that offers street food dishes. Definitely worth the try! It\'s another noodle dish, using blanched egg noodles and topped with ground chicken and broccoli. I personally love egg noodles so I knew I was gonna be a fan. Even though I didn\'t expect the sauce to be so sweet, the good ol texture of my fave type of noodles just hit the spot. I love trying new dishes!\n\n- Thai Fried Rice w/ Chicken ($14) - This one was a bit disappointing. I should\'ve known it was too basic of a choice... it just tasted bland and underwhelming for me. Would definitely go for a curry rice dish instead next time. I\'d suggest skipping this altogether.\n\nTFK is a great, loving business that cares about its community while serving delicious + authentic Thai food. Proud to share the neighborhood with them, and I\'m looking forward to coming back.', 'My FAVORITE Thai place in Brooklyn. Amazing, makes me feel reminiscent of when I visited Thailand.', 'Pad sea ew was DISGUSTING. No sauce, noodles cold and hard. Literally gross. No flavor. Yuck. I want my money back.', ""On this #ThankYouThursday I'm singing the praises of a great Thai restaurant over here in Kensington, Brooklyn. They first caught my attention when my favorite food writer Ligaya Mishan wrote of their unique flavors when they first opened, but I somehow never got around to trying their food until I noticed they were in my delivery radius today. I also want to give them a shout out because during this pandemic they've been graciously offering anyone who is elderly or disabled a free meal if they are within one mile of the restaurant, no questions asked. The kindness that people have shown during these trying times is one of the few things that spark joy for me these days, so I'd like to thank them especially for that.\n\nTheir signature Thai Farm pad thai really stood out to me for the crispy calamari they top the dish with. While the calamari didn't stay crunchy through delivery, there were generous pieces of it and it was delicious regardless, going so well with the sweet, spicy, & salty flavors of the noodles. The portion was hefty and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. I also enjoyed their papaya salad, which had a nice amount of spice from the bird's eye chili. They take spice seriously which to me is a sign of an excellent and authentically Thai dining experience. My partner loved the ribs, which came in huge meaty pieces and marinated in a sweet and salty rub. We're also about to dig into the Panang curry, which smells very promising.\n\nWhile this meal cost me almost $100, it was because of predatory delivery fees and not really because of the restaurant. I realize that everything comes at a premium now but I'm glad at least the flavors were premium enough to justify this once in a while indulgence."", ""We ordered lunch from Thai Farm Kitchen recently, and it was delicious. I liked their phad Thai, which had really good, balanced flavors, was not too sweet, and included more fried calamari and shrimp than I was expecting. What I liked even more was their kao thod nhaem klook, one of my favorite Thai dishes that not every restaurant serves. The dish consisted of a couple of fried curry rice balls, both whole and smashed, along with fermented pork sausage, peanuts, and other herbs, and it was packed with bright, bold flavors. It had been a while since I'd had it anywhere, and I was really happy with their version. Everything arrived on time, was packed well, and portions were a generous size. Hopefully one day we'll dine in there, but for now, we'll just keep ordering delivery. Looking forward to trying more dishes soon!""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-farm-kitchen-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

It wasn't overly sweet, which is great since a lot of vegan baked goods tend to have way to much sugar. The consistency was great and it was really tasty.

We opted to do indoor dining. It was my first time doing indoor dining. The tables seemed spaced out, but still full. In other words, they seemed to be appropriately spaced out to give each party a sense of privacy whereas pre-COVID era, tables could be just inches apart.\n\nNot that we were worried about privacy because the music was so awfully loud that we could barely hear each other. So if you decide to indoor dine here, don't come here if you want to catch up with friends. The outdoor space seemed much quieter.\n\nThe drinks were 14 dollars and masterfully crafted! Everything' here also felt bigger like the cocktails came in bigger glasses, the tapas weren't really tapa sized. The food was all very delicious! I appreciated the generous portion. My favorites were the steak and the rigatoni pasta with pistachio cream! My friends really liked the gnocchi and the endives!\n\nI can see myself coming back as the menu seems like it changes (maybe seasonally?). But next time, hopefully we can snag a quieter spot outside."", ""Yesterday (Tuesday night), my partner and I came to Traif to celebrate our two-year anniversary. I made a reservation for 6:30pm. When we arrived, we were the only people in the restaurant. While this did allow us to choose if we wanted to sit outside, in the patio, or in the restaurant, it was a little odd being completely alone in a big restaurant. We chose to sit inside as it was too cold to sit outside when the staff couldn't turn on a heater. If I go back, I'll definitely book a table for 7:30, as people didn't start to arrive until 7.\n\nThe cocktails were 10/10. I had the red pearl, a chili tequila, strawberry and basil drink. Super fresh and a great start. My partner had the little piggy drink, a pomegranate tequila drink with a bacon rim. We also shared a bottle of wine during the meal.\n\nThe food was 8/10 for me. We chose to do the Chef's Selection, which is 8-10 dishes for $55/pp. Some dishes were great: the duck breast, the spicy tuna tartar and then pesto pasta dish. Other dishes were interesting but not great: the cinnamon strawberry ribs, the fried snapper and the curry risotto. An issue I had was the timing of the dishes. We were served the first 7 dishes within half an hour! I had to ask for them to slow down, as at multiple times during the meal multiple dishes were shoved on our small table, allowing food to get cold before we had the chance to eat it.\n\nOverall, I don't think I'd come back but I don't regret visiting. If I do come back, I'd book a later table and order single dishes rather than do the chef's selection.\n\nAfter a 20% gratuity was added on the check, we paid around $240 for the drinks and food."", ""Just hit top of my tasting list in NYC area\n\nInsane food, and even more insane value.\n\nWords cannot describe how phenomenal the food and service are at this great little spot.\n\nThis would literally be my go to if it wasn't for my snobby wife who can't stand the thought of going anyplace that involves crossing a river.\n\nThe tasting menu, in terms of food, certainly trumps many places around Manhattan that are considered some of the best restaurants in the world.\n\nSo long as you're not hung up on the ultimate service experience or the whole bragging to your friends that you went some place that was $600+ per person, I would strongly recommend this place.\n\nOne other thing... pace yourself... the portions here are often times quite large for a tasting menu of any size... but for this many courses, if you eat more then a couple bites of each bit, you will probably only make it to course 5-7 before tapping out."", ""Ever wondered how disappointment would taste like? Come by here and you'll know exactly what disappointments tastes like upon your first bite.\n\nAfter reading all the raving reviews and what not, I decided to come here after nabbing a reservation for Valentine's Day. They had a prefix menu for the occasion, which contains 11 dishes including dessert. After reading through the menu, everything sounded amazing. You have the option of going for the regular tasting menu for $75 or the baller, which is $100 and certain dishes you get all the add on that's available for a few dishes. We opted for the baller.\n\nFirst dish was a Moroccan curry and chick pea soup. This came in a shot glass. It was essentially gritty curry soup. The soup was average, nothing amazing and we were hoping things can only go up from here right? Not so right.\n\nNext 2 dishes was also a letdown. The winter carpese was bland and the scallops were dry.\n\nThe tuna tartar was when things started looking up. The tuna tartar was pretty good. A little spicy but just the right amount of kick needed to know it has flavor. I was thinking maybe the first 2 is to lure you in with low expectations than they crush it with the rest?!\n\nThe duck confit was also good. Crispy and tender at the same time, this paired really well with the Japanese yam sauce and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. With the way things were going, I thought the meal was saved.\n\nNext was the pork belly bao but ours was upgraded to have foie gras instead. This bao was incredibly average and underwhelming. You don't really taste the foie fras at all, making me question at this point if the upgrade was worth it.\n\nNext up was the steak frites upgraded with mishima wagyu filet mignon. I was really looking forward to this one so couldn't contain my excitement when it came...only to be let down. This was a $30 upgrade if you didn't get the baller option. Essentially seems like regular filet, and only 6 pieces. Definitely not worth it as the meat wasn't even tasteful. I guess that's what all the sauce was for.\n\nThe lamb osso bucco was splendid. It was a good portion size, tender meat and great taste. This kind of at least sated my appetite and didn't have me leaving hungry.\n\nI think if you go somewhere and it charges you $100/person, it should either be delicious or enough food to keep you full. This place sadly did not fulfill either and I left extremely disappointed. I've wasted money before, but this one actually hurts."", ""Amazing hidden gem and worth the trek. This place is incredible. You can do an 8-course tasting menu for $55, or order a-la carte. We went with the a-la carte option (ordered 5 dishes), but the next table did the tasting menu. Both seem to be great options. All the dishes were uniquely delicious and generously portioned. We left the restaurant super full and happy. It was honestly one of the best meals we've had.\n\nWe ordered the Gnocchi, Tuna Tartar, Cauliflower Salad, Scallops and the Short Ribs Sliders. We also ordered the Bacon Donuts as dessert.

I ordered the $7 blackened chicken special (white meat option, no extra charge) that comes with one side. I chose the coconut yams. The white meat was so juicy and well seasoned, and the skin nicely blackened. The coconut yams were yummy, perfectly tender and not overly sweet.

I had the Shrimp Po Boy and she had the fried fish dinner they were both phenomenal. Each meal came with two sides. I had mac and cheese and fries and for the other meal, the sides were candied yams and mac and cheese. Finding quality mac & cheese now and days is really like searching for a needle in a haystack but I found the needle here. The mac& cheese was baked to perfection, rich taste, and lots of cheese. The candied yams didn't look very candied and I was nervous at first but it was sooo delicious. They have the cutest little waiting corner with books by Black authors and about black leaders. While I waited for my food I was able to pick up a book and read for a few minutes. The gentleman who was at the front was very personable and sweet. I can't wait to come back."", ""Awesome find by Nostrand & Atlantic Ave for seafood and delicious sides.\n\nWe called ahead for pick-up, glad we did as this is a popular spot.\n\nFirstly, you MUST get the Mac & Cheese. I preferred the regular to the seafood version but both are great.\n\nI had the blackened salmon (a big healthy portion and cooked perfectly) and my boyfriend had the fried catfish with hot honey -- the hot honey was ESPECIALLY good.\n\nThe service is great as well, the man behind the counter was friendly and asked about our order right away during busy hours.\n\nCan't wait to try the rest of the menu"", ""Awesome food! It stands out from the rest of the soul food establishments. Their sides and desserts have their own twist, but what makes them unique. Many choices to choose from, and made fresh. Since their food is fresh, the dessert options depend on what was made that day.  \n\nMy only gripe is the wait, but honestly, I should expect some waiting time. If I just said the food was great you know I'm not the only one who thinks so. To avoid waiting for a long period of time; just call ahead. The service I've encountered from when I arrive there, to when I leave is amazing! I was greeted with respect and courtesy. Even I had an experience where my order was wrong. They solved it to my expectations right away.\n\nYes, and yes. I would recommend the Black Nile."", ""Grits are the best I've ever tasted PERIOD. It should be illegal for them to be so good. WOW\n\nThe blackened salmon was a bit dry and over cooked and the blackened scallops too salty. So perhaps avoid the blackened option for seafood.\n\nBut the seafood cornbread-- TO DIE FOR.\n\nGREENS - BANGIN."", 'With all that is going on in the world we all need some comfort food and respect. Black Nile gives you both.\nThe gentleman taking our order was Hasson. He was welcoming, helpful in selections,  patient and professional with all the customers; and there were Lots of customers. This place is busy and I know why.\nI had the pepper grits with fried whiting and it was perfectly fried and seasoned.  The combination was so warming to my soul.  I took home a shrimp po boy with Cajun pasta, once again, delicious. Also had a side of yams with coconut and seasoned broccoli, both were very good. Will definitely be back for the food and awesome service. So happy they are in the neighborhood!', ""I walked in and felt so bad that they were about to close, but I HAD to try the food here! I was so pleased that we were still able to order literally half of the menu right before close. While we waited on our dinner, the dessert display was staring at me...so I had to get the chocolate chip cookies ($6 for 2), ohhh my goodness they were beyond me, so soft and delicious. I didn't plan on eating both right before dinner but it couldn't stop! We family style ordered, so we got the fried shrimp with cornbread dressing and sweet plantains. The seafood platter with grilled salmon, crab cakes, garlic shrimp penne w/ a white cream sauce. The fried chicken tenders with mashed potatoes and plantains. Yo, it made no sense as to how much love and flavor was in every bite! I would recommend Black Nile, over and over again!"", ""This restaurant is amazing... the food was great and the owner was really nice and accommodating!! The atmosphere was friendly and inviting. I'll definitely go again when I'm in town."", 'If you have not tried this place, YOU NEED TO! This establishment popped up as a suggested place by Yelp and I am soo happy with the recommendation.\n\nI love good customer service. The owner greeted everyone with a smile, was patient (even when busy), and thanked each and every customer and stated he looked forward to you returning. I love when you go in a restaurant and it feels like your among family. That is good customer service and that is often hard to come by.\n\nMy partner and I tried the Cajun trio (crab cakes, shrimp, and salmon), Mac and cheese, coconut yams, blueberry cornbread, brown sugar bbq chicken and waffles. I have no complaints! The chicken was tender and flavorful; I enjoyed the flavor so much I regretted not ordering it for myself. The mac and cheese was flavorful, cheesy, and complimented the coconut yams so well. All of the seafood was cooked to perfection and the blend of spices with the sauce on top was amazing.\n\nJust make it your business to get here!', 'The food was amazing. I ordered the fried chicken white meat with baked mac & cheese and cajun alfredo pasta, and wow, I was shocked. As it was my first time trying the food at Black Nile, I did not expect to be blown away by the flavors. The only con was the time it took waiting for the food and the constant call in to get my order, so I would suggest that you order ahead of time to avoid the wait, but again the food was worth the wait.']",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/black-nile-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

And come. Again.', 'We stopped in over the weekend due to good reviews, a nice outdoor eating space, and a hankering for both ramen and sushi.\n\nWe had the basic pork ramen, the shimp bun sandwich, the mango shrimp sushi  - then a side of grilled chicken, extra ramen noodles, and another soft-boiled egg (kids favorites).\n\nThis seems like the type of place where there are enough options to find something you really love. The thing we loved the most was the grilled chicken. Everything else was pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable to eat and certainly good enough to come back and try other options.\n\nFor more specifics, the ramen felt like it was missing something - added hot sauce and a bit of soy to kick it up a notch. The shrimp buns were great when getting to the saucy area at the end, but were otherwise a little dry. Nothing to say about the sushi specifically, it was fine to eat, just not my thing in the end.\n\nProbably 3.5 stars in the end, but the grilled chicken was so good, that I decided on 4. Also, the service was very good - super friendly staff, and felt nice and safe for pandemic dining.', ""A place dedicated to all things buns is a utopia I'd readily sign myself up to visit any day of the week. Buntopia has a no frills storefront heavily reliant on delivery/takeout but they have a lone table set up out front to eat at. Their menu includes a long list of buns, ramen, and rice rolls catering to pretty much any palate and diet but is especially amenable to vegetarians. In fact there are more vegetarian options than not, including a tasty vegan nugget ramen, veggie gyoza, and several types of salads. The main event though is really any of their bunburgers, which come as a pair and can be a light and inexpensive meal in and of themselves.\n\nI ordered the Shrimpatation bunburger which consists of tempura shrimp, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, greens, peanuts, and a tasty spicy mayo apple vinegar sauce that really tied it all together. I was impressed with the contrast of sweet, salty, and spicy as well as the medley of textures. The crispy tempura batter paired so well with the fluffy bao bun that I was happy there was more than one bun in my order. $8 is a great deal for 2 generously filled buns. My dining companions though the Aloha Slider, which was the grilled chicken bunburger, was one of the best buns they've ever had.\n\nI'm glad to see they seem to have a robust delivery operation going to offset the lack of indoor dining here, so I hope to see them surviving the pandemic. I'd love to try many of their other menu items."", ""Those buns!! Call me weird or not but I have been wanting to try out a dish that serves buns absolutely glad I found this place. The owner of the place is Sean, who was very nice to take his time to help me.\n\nAmbiance- 5/5\n\nLaid back, good for causal dining or take out. The decor overall is simple with some nice pictures in the sitting area.\n\nCleanliness- 5/5\n\nSurely they make a constant effort to keep the place clean and request all customers to kindly dispose their trash. Employees and the owner himself were consistently wiping the tables during their downtime.\n\nCustomer service- 4/5\n\nI took 1 star away for customer service as I feel the employees can be more attentive and interactive. Upon entering, I encountered one employee that was surely not very much interactive. He seemed to be like whatever the whole time I was there. I asked him few questions regarding their menu items but he definitely lacked enthusiasm to help. Though Sean, was amazing as he assisted me with my order and was very sweet overall.\n\nParking- Sunday is a great day for driving and free parking. Accessible via MTA as well but I personally prefer to drive as the commute from Long Island can be very long via MTA.\n\nFood- 5/5\n\nI definitely love their menu as they have quite a few options for vegetarians like moi. I liked their sweet potato fries, which were slightly salted but next time I'll definitely order them without salt. Oasis Baja burger buns were amazing for $7 (2 pieces). Omg I don't know how they made their mango sauce but oh boy it was absolutely delicious making all my taste buds happy."", ""Buntopia is a good spot for a quick on the go snack, they have a table outside but also a backyard to eat at which is nice. The dumplings where good ! The salmon avocado roll was a bit stale. The matcha lemonade is good but remember it's BOBBA so don't sip on it too hard like I did lol. The most annoying thing was that the sauces are .50 cents and we didn't order them with our original order but they still charges us for it through tip. Order your sauce with the order."", ""My go to place for bao buns really love the shrimptation really great flavor and I also love the mango tango sushi. First time trying the salad and it was really good I can't recommend this place enough. They prepare your food really fast and again super fresh ingredients with great flavor."", ""Great food and service for a very reasonable price! I recommend any of the sushi and Asian style ramen. I have yet to try one of the buns, but it's next on my list. Plenty of vegan and vegetarian options that are actually tasty. The food comes out super fast too!"", ""So happy to stumble upon this restaurant in the pouring rain. I was waiting for someone for about 45mins without ordering anything and they didn't kick me out. I am sincerely grateful.\n\nThe food was mouth-wateringly delicious. I was debating between the Villa Kuta, Sashimi Salmon Bowl, and Tom Yam Kai Ramen. I finally went with the Tom Yam Kai Ramen for $12. It consists of Grilled Chicken Breast, Naruto Fish Cake, Soft Boiled Egg, Lime, Makrut Lime Leaves, topped with spinach, enoki mushroom, sweet corn, and scallion in Thai Tom Yum Broth. The broth was super flavorful!\n\nI like the culture that this restaurant created. You clean up your own eating area.

Perfect with rich food!\n- Housemade Limoncello : this was way stronger than I thought! First, you taste the alcohol, and then the aroma of lemons. It definitely works well as a digestive, cleaning the palate after a rich meal...but it's intense! It might be because my family makes a sweeter, more syrupy Limoncello...but this one really got to my head. Sip it carefully, it's a bomb!\n\nFood:\n- Torretta di Melanzane: I love eggplant, and here it was fried to perfection. The burrata is creamy and fresh and the basil brings up the whole dish.

While we contemplated a number of possibilities, in the end, it had to be the Brookkolina, which comes topped with broccoli rabe, Italian sausage, and jalapeño.

I miss the contrast of the crisp outside and the pillowy insides but doused in the smoky ketchup they were still pretty good."", 'Awesome pop-up that is only open on the FIRST FRIDAY of the month. Used to be open every Friday so it might revert back. Tried the Fancy Nancy and enjoyed the tomato soup that comes with the sandwich. Glad I tried it but the wait was long!', ""I was unaware of this place.  \n*Gasp*!  Me?  The grilled-cheese fanatic?!  \n\nIn fact, I was brought here during a series of restaurant/bar-hopping by my OC escort, who will be unnamed, but elbows point to John K.\n\nHaving tried tons of grilled cheese spots, the flavors were pretty much predictable, so I wasn't expecting much except just a regular good ol' sandwich.  But Hot DAMN!  I believe we had The Outlaw or Don Poblano.  It was a gooey-ness of Gruyere and Fontina in-yo-face flavors!  The bread was grilled to perfection.. soft, with a thin outer layer of crispness.  What made it extra special was the tomato soup dipping sauce - warm, rich, and acidic enough to cut all the grease from that divine cheese.\n\nIt's so simple, yet so satisfying.  They don't skimp on the cheese either.. you get a nice bread-to-cheese ratio.  The portion size is slightly larger than your average sando as well.  All the future gasses in my stomach and/or butt can never keep me away from this cheesy mess! Don't act like cheese doesn't make you gassy, Miss Classy.\n\nAmbiance is clean and modern.  The space is small with tables set up closely to each other.  I could literally join the conversation from the people sitting next to me.  Reminds me of shared tables in Europe.  Small and quaint.  Thank you table-next-to-me for letting me invade your space.\n\nCan't wait to come back again!  Come hungry, come prepared.. with Beano."", ""These sandos are the bomb dot com! The girls are lovely, super passionate, and make each sandwich (or delicious pancake) with thoughtfulness! It is so great to see a business run this way! It is a rotating menu to give each favorite a shot and I'm sure you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. We had the west coast fling (it's more than a fling, it could be a serious life long love) and the Homer (donut grilled cheese? Hollah!)\n\nSandwiches are the best, ingredients are the best, customer service is the best! Flock to the best and most creative grilled cheeses ever!

I love the freaks and geeks sandwich. It's so damn good, especially with the brilliant tomato soup dip and reduced balsamic. Add to that how awesome of a person the chef is, and this situation is a winner.\n\nCHEEEEEEESE!!!!"", 'We went to The Blue Light Speak Cheesy when it was a pop-up at Dynaco. I just checked their site and it looks like they are there Mon-Fri evenings for dinner. Dynaco is a fun bar and you should check them out, too.\n\nBack to the food from The Blue Light Speak Cheesy! We popped into Dynaco because of the sign outside advertising the grilled cheese pop-up. Sooo glad we finally got a chance to check this place out because I had been lurking on their Yelp page for awhile. We settled in at a couple of seats at the bar and grabbed our drinks.\n\nWe were planning on ordering some grilled cheeses already but the girl making the sammies came out and gave us samples of the Classic grilled cheese, a sharp cheddar on sourdough. It was SOOOO good. The cheese was super flavorful, perfectly melty, and the sourdough had a great lil tang to it that balanced out the heaviness of eating a cheese sandwich.\n\nSince we got a sample of the Classic, we felt like we should try something different so I ordered the French Onion and my boyfriend ordered the Outlaw. They both came with tomato soup dip, which was so delicious, by the way. The French Onion literally tasted like eating a solid version of french onion soup - which sounds like a really weird description but it was sooooooo amazing. I really enjoyed it and it was nice to have the tomato dip to sort of ""change it up"" and palate cleanse every so often. My boyfriend\'s Outlaw was SUPER flavorful - the smoked gouda was delicious with a really strong flavor that worked really well with harissa. In fact, the French Onion and Outlaw were kind of a perfect pair to split because the French Onion was very savory and the Outlaw was like a flavor bomb. So it was perfect to eat some of one, then the other, and kind of switch back and forth.\n\nCan\'t wait to try more of the sandwiches and, really, get another taste of that Classic cus it was also so good!']",,[],https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-blue-light-speak-cheesy-brooklyn-9?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

It came out in a whole heated tray (imagine hot pot, but a tray), and you just pick your food out of it. It was so delicious! I also ordered two sides (not realizing they were sides), eggplant and prawns, and they were also spectacular. My boyfriend and I shared and we both felt like we were going to pop by the time we finished everything. They gave us complimentary dessert, kind of like a grass jelly bubble tea soup, and offered us seconds (my boyfriend got a third serving). I can't complain at all. The only drawback is because of the style of this kind of food, I don't think it lends itself to takeout. They also don't have outdoor seating, I think because it doesn't work with the equipment they use to serve the fish. Therefore, we ate inside, which I was hesitant about given covid, but they are very clean and careful and the tables are far apart from one another."", ""The food at Hot Space was great, but the phenomenal service is the reason I'm giving this place five stars.\n\nThe roasted scallop, which came in a large shell, was sliced up and mixed with vermicelli noodles and garlic. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The roasted frog was alright. The meat was flavorful, but it needed some kind of glaze or sauce.\n\nI really liked the sea bass, which was the star of the show. We ordered it with two flavors (spicy garlic and black pepper oyster sauce), along with soft tofu, enoki mushrooms, lotus root, and Chinese cabbage. It arrived in a large split pan that the waiters kept heated. The spicy garlic flavor didn't have much garlic taste, mostly spice, but I loved the black pepper oyster sauce. The black pepper was quite strong though, so if that's not your thing, avoid this flavor. The enoki mushrooms, cabbage, and tofu were also delicious. I wish the lotus root had been cooked down and softer.\n\nNow, onto the service. First of all, we got a bunch of free items. Since we got two flavors for our fish, we received a free chilled dish of tofu and preserved eggs in oyster sauce and sesame oil. This was sooo good. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The sauce was simple yet addicting, and it even made me enjoy preserved eggs, which I normally dislike. I ordered passion fruit green tea and they gave us plum iced tea and kumquat lemon iced tea on the house. At the end of our meal we also received dessert bowls of grass jelly in coconut/soy milk.\n\nOur waiters kept checking on us and asking how everything was. They seemed genuinely interested in finding out how I knew about the restaurant and making sure we enjoyed our food.

They bring to you scrumptious and juicy seafood on a huge pan, with a burner under it to keep the heat (temperature and taste) going.\n\nYou get to select 4 vegetables to get a slight discount on them, which is a pretty great idea. The vegetables cut the spice and the oil, as well as boosts the longevity of the already massive dish. After all, diversity is great.\n\nAnd the experience is great as soon as you enter. The staff are very friendly and hyper attentive to the point of near excess.

Did I really want to commute all the way to Brooklyn for this place? No. Was it worth it? No.\n\nIf you do not eat fish, frog or seafood, then this is not the place for you. There's no beef/chicken/pork as the main entree. Only seafood here. Pick your seafood, then your sauce and other add-ins like veggies.\n\nI had the sea bass with garlic sauce and some veggies, as well as the peppercorn frog. The food comes out on giant trays and it is sizzling. Sea bass completely missed the mark for me. Lacked flavor but salty and quite difficult to eat.\n\nThe frog was the hero of the night. There was actually a good proportion of frog - not just wood ears and hidden veggies. Frog was super tender and flavorful.\n\nAlso, I tried two apps - the tripe and the cucumber. Tripe was fine but the cucumber was more pickled than I preferred."", ""I came here for dinner on a Thursday night with a group of 3 people.  I was surprised the place was pretty crowded.

We got the cabbage, tofu, bean curd, and Chinese vegetables.  The fish took a while to come out.  They give you sunflower seeds and peanuts to snack on while waiting.  The fish was cooked well and there were a lot of toppings.  The fish itself was rather small though and pretty pricey.  Even a bowl of rice is an extra $1, it's weird that they don't include it with the fish.  Service was fast and attentive.  I don't know if I would come back since it's pretty expensive for just one fish."", ""Came here to try their grilled fish. They ran out of buffalo fish so we had to get the sea bass. It was $50 for the fish alone without any accoutrements. We got the golden combination which included enoki, kelp knots, potato slices, and lotus slices. The sea bass was suppose to be about 2 lbs ended up being just enough for 2 people. We would have been hungry without the accoutrements we got. It's a shame they ran out of buffalo fish because that's usually 4lbs. We also ended up getting grilled chicken wings which had a nice flavor but could have been cooked a bit longer. The center was slightly more pink than I like and the skin not rendered quite enough.\n\nThe service was quite good and staff was very attentive and helpful. The decor was interesting in that there is a huge screen of Chinese karaoke videos playing.\n\nThe beers here are crazy cheap at only $3 for a Sapporo. This seems like a fun place I would come back to.\n\nIt's a bit expensive for what it is, but I think had we gotten the buffalo fish it would have been better value.

The slightest bit of sweetness.\n\n2) Raw clams: I almost always prefer raw oysters to clams but I like trying them anyway and so far this was one of the better raw clams I've had. The texture is bouncy and almost mushroom-like but not tough. It's a bit fishy but also slightly sweet. I can't eat a ton of these but definitely wanted a couple more.\n\n3) Octopus: My friend loved this dish and I enjoyed it but didn't think it was a must get. The octopus itself is firm but still has a very smooth, easy bite to it. The salsa verde had a very earthy, cumin-like flavor that took over a bit for me. The sumac is a nice acidic balance though I wanted more of it. I didn't get the lemon much at all (I ended up adding some of my own and that helped it along). (3.75/5)\n\n4) Daily appetizer special (Flour chicharron, ahi tuna, chorizo, tomato, radish, avocado): Served like a tostada but instead of a corn tortilla you get a fluffy crispy chicharron and honestly I love it. I usually find the maiz flavor of tostadas take over the dish too much but this adds crunch while not overtaking the flavors of the meat. The ahi was soft but had a nice meaty bite and a pretty strong fishy flavor. The chorizo was really soft and almost creamy. Loved the slight bit of spice and the smokiness it brought to the dish. I think a bit of honey was used in the sauce which did help tie the components together but the chorizo still ended up taking over the tuna a bit more than I would've liked. (3.5/5)\n\nOverall, this was a great spot for a quick afternoon snack. It is quite pricey and our bill came out to about $58 without any drinks. But I'm always willing to drop money for quality seafood. Would definitely love to come back for happy hour."", ""I'm baaaaaack!!!!!\n\nI can not get enough of this place. They just do it right here.\n\nThe better half of me was feeling fancy and wanted to go out and enjoy some oysters. The only place that came to mind was Bar Crudo.\n\nThey're known for their oysters. They have oysters from all over. Seattle, Canada, Massachusetts, Maine and the list goes on. They're always fresh and full of flavor.\n\nTheir oyster menu rotates. You may go one day and the selection may be limited. You return another day and you'll have to ask their amazing waiters for help.\n\nIf you're a fan of coconut you must/have to try the White Coconut Sangria. I took one sip and had to reflect on life it was so good.\n\nThis is a great place and I know I will be back."", 'Hi Brandon,\n\nThank you for taking the time to write a review.

I rarely come to Greenpoint (or wherever this is located) so I don't really know the backstory, but I've been to one or two now and they're all really quite good.\n\nOrdered the stuffed cabbage and the breaded pork cutlet. The meal comes with this really heavy soup with a lot of sausage in it (FYI this is not a good place for vegetarians to come), accompanied with some bread. I saw a lot of people opt for a bread bowl, which I don't regret not getting (because I was super full afterwards), but it looked really good. The stuffed cabbage was excellent. Literally everything here is good. I can't think of anything more to write."", ""I remembered the delicacies of Polish food when I travelled there years ago and it's such a delight to find them here, just a subway ride away. Greenpoint might not be sprinkled with skyscrappers the way Manhattan is but this small area in Brooklyn has a soft charm of its own which I'm inexplicably drawn to. Anyhow, went to Karczma for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. They are open for outdoor and some indoor dining. It was quite warm so we eat outside. Staffs were friendly, although service takes some time (but they were very busy indeed so just be patient)\nOrdered the Plates of Polish Specialties, consisting of:\n- 3 pierogis (mushroom, potato, pork), which seem to be deep fried instead of steamed. The potato might be tastiest as it was super creamy but all 3 were good\n- Potato latke: thin pancake made of grated potatoes. It's crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. So so so good\n- Kielbasa (polish sausage) was delicious\n- Bigos (Polish hunter's stew) made of sauerkraut, kielbasa, tomato base and several other ingredients I can't identify. I hoped for it to be more sour because it was a bit too sweet for us\n- Golabki (stuffed cabbage), filled with mixture of pork, mushroom, rice, slathered in tangy tomato sauce. I think the cabbage went really well with the sauce and the filling was good!\n\nWe forgot there's already Golabki and had another Golabki dish, served with peas & mashed potato. Overall it was a very satisfying, hearty meal and it will keep you full for quite a while.\nReasonably priced. Each plate costs under $20"", 'My husband and I came here for a late lunch while exploring the neighborhood on Labor Day. It was the only place open on the holiday.\n\nThe staff was a bit neglectful but overall nice when interacting.\n\nWe ordered the Polish Classic platter and the carrot horseradish side. Both dishes were very good and we really enjoyed everything!', 'Stopped in the other day for a lunch break and was so stoked to have some authentic Polish food, and it did not disappoint.\n\nSince NYC is still being stringent with dining rules, they only had outside dining, but at the time there was no one else at the spot, so we had lots of places to choose from.\n\nService was very friendly, a European waitress, very sweet, came over to take our orders, told us the specials, guided us through the food choices, and we ordered.\n\nPickle Soup, Pork Cutlet, Smoked Sausage, Borscht and Czech Republic Beers were all a hit.\n\nThe Pickle Soup was hot and flavorful, lots of cabbage and hot, tasty and a good start the meal, with some Mashed Potatoes and Onions served for the table.\n\nThe Smoked Sausage was also great, with Cabbage and it was Spicy, plenty of meat to mix with the cabbage, and the cold beer to wash it down.\n\nGreat place, totally recommend!', ""We got takeout from Karczma before heading to the Skyline Drive-In. They do have nice outdoor seating, FYI. Though the restaurant was bustling with sidewalk diners and takeout orders, we waited only about 12 to 15 minutes for our order.\n\nI was happy to discover that Karczma has a good selection of vegetarian fare, which is sometimes not the case when it comes to Polish food. We sampled the kasha with vegetables, the fried potatoes with dill and garlic, and the potato and cheese pierogi. Portions sizes are impressive. The kasha was tasty, with mushrooms aplenty. The fried potatoes with garlic and dill were my favorite. They're very, very garlicky (in a good way) perfectly crisp, even in a takeout container. The pierogi were delicious too, although they were fried and my preference, unlike that for Chinese dumplings, is to have them steamed.\n\nI recommend Karczma and will return for takeout, indoor dining, or outdoor dining when there aren't heat advisories in effect."", ""I absolutely love this place! Came here after throwing axes with my boyfriend and friends ... the drinks were AMAZING you will not be disappointed with anything. Try the mulled wine and the polish mojito. Food was phenomenal and portions huge. Definitely try the desserts- cheesecake was so delicious. I'm definitely coming back and they definitely made the day wonderful."", ""I was in a mood for polish food and finally went all the way to Greenpoint to have some. This place is an institution in the neighborhood and fills up fast on weekends. I love the interior, rustic and yet polished.\n\nWe went on a Friday evening around 6:30p and were lucky to immediately find seats at the bar. Tables were all taken, and by the time we were done dining there was a wait at the door.\n\nWhite borscht served in bread: get it. The broth is flavorful and the bread soaked in it is yummy.\n\nPeasant style lard: it was ok, but compared to Italian lard (such as the Colonnata lard), it didn't have much of a flavor. It was underwhelming.\n\nHunter bacon: tasty, and the caramelized onions were great.\n\nStuffed mushrooms: a bit dry, but still ok. I wish they used better quality mushrooms, though.\n\nPierogi: I know people here seem to go crazy about them, but I found them to be disappointing. The dough was ok, but the 3 different types of fillings were boring.\n\nRoasted hocks in beer: very tender meat, although a little dry. The skin was soft and very chewy, though... I was hoping it would be crunchy.\n\nOverall, although we enjoyed some dishes, we found others to be underwhelming. The service was friendly and professional, which helped compensating for the dishes we didn't particularly enjoy."", ""I don't understand the hype.  The people were lovely and the food was cheap and warm and came quickly but it just wasn't tasty.  I love Polish food and have gone out of my way for bigos and pierogis multiple times. This might be the worst polish food I've ever had - everything was dry, flavorless, and just plain. No depth of flavor. No love.  \n\nI've been back multiple times based on the hype and I've tried most of the menu. I really wanted to like it.  I just don't. New York can do better."", 'Delicious polish food. Hock was amazing! The 3 people meat platter is big enough for 5!', ""Karczma is a beautiful place. This will be one of my simpler reviews, because I think my message is clear: Karczma is great, go to Karczma.\n\nThe quality of the food at Karczma merits four (4) full stars. When I went, I got the lunch special, which came with żurek, kiełbasa, mashed potatoes, a gołąbek, and a few other goodies. The food was voluptuously delicious--everything was rich and flavorful. Also, the portions were enormous. Even though it was a lunch special, it was enough for two meals.\n\nAn additional one (1) star goes to the price/value ratio at this restaurant. The prices are amazing--e.g. lunch special for $12.50 that was enough for two meals! Would highly recommend if you want a nice meal while not breaking the bank.\n\nOn top of this, the ambience and the experience at Karczma are very nice--they have some Eastern European folk decor around the restaurant. Very nice!\n\nI would highly recommend Karczma for all of your Polish food needs, and all of your value needs. I would go back here in a heartbeat next time I'm in Greenpoint (followed by a stop at A&S Warehouse, of course).""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/karczma-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

The tables were distanced way more than 6ft with outside seating available. The menu was exquisite! The owner/manager was very gracious and served us wild berry sorbets, complements from the house! Overall a wonderful experience for my husband and I. Will come back again!', ""Wow, every single plate I had here was excellent. The menu is definitely an homage to seasonality and all of the ingredients were elevated and harmonious and perfectly autumnal. I was just walking around Greenpoint looking for a place to eat when I noticed the dinner tables by the big open windows. The restaurant seems to be well set up for a well-ventilated indoor/outdoor dining experience.\n\nI wasn't in the market for a tasting menu with a wine pairing, but after trying a few dishes here, I'm confident I wouldn't have regretted the tasting menu.\n\nThe truffle gruyere croquetas were super crisp on the outside with a creamy interior. The beet salad was plated beautifully with all kinds of fascinating textures from a cheese crisp to puffed grain bits, citrusy foam and multi colored beets. The rubataga soup was a sleeper hit. It had these soft-roasted delicata squash nestled in a creamy and flavorful rubataga puréed soup with fried brussel sprouts leaves as a topping. I loved the contrast of textures. The kurobuta pork came with a stuffed pepper and a stewed plum - mmm! The meat was juicy yet had a crisp, almost candied exterior.\n\n10/10 would recommend and come back. Also a solid wine list!"", ""If I could have given 10 stars I would. Where do I begin. From the moment we walked up to Madre, which is located in the lobby of The Franklin Guesthouse, we were treated like family.\n\nThis sheik restaurants ambiance was very inviting and made us want to stay all night hanging out enjoying drinks.\n\nThe menu here is not a big one but it is an impressive one. We literally tried almost everything on the menu and each item impressed us more and more. The cornbread Madelines were amazing and complimented w a honey butter. The Castelvetrano olives were perfect for picking. Now let's talk about Croquetas all I have to say is OH MY GOD. You could literally eat addicted in just one bite. The black truffle complimented the gruyer and exploded w flavor w every bite. Absolutely amazing dish. My wife and I love oysters and these were some of the best oysters I have ever had. The charcuterie board had lady Edison ham which was very good but the food gras and chicken liver moose were absolutely INSANE. Bravo guys this hit it out of the park.\n\nNow onto main courses. I'm a huge fan of grilled octopus and this was some outrageous grilled octopus. So tender it cut w a fork and the sauce they used w it was fire. The chicken was incredible and as per the chef takes 5 days to make. The Kurobuta Pork was also another home run by this very talented crew. Everything that came out of that kitchen was a culinary masterpiece. Chef Bryan also made us a tremendous US Wagyu Bone in ribeye. This was the evenings grand slam. This was the ultimate closer to an already amazing meal. Like I said everything that came out of the kitchen was made w love and pride tri masterpieces.\n\nLet's talk about service. The service was great. The wait staff was excellent. Super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. Very attentive you didn't wait more then a few mins for a drink and always within an ear shot if you had a question. Food came to the table for n a timely manner the place isn't very bug so I'm sure that helped but still very good service. Our bartender was also a true master of her craft. Created a couple of custom cocktails for the wives that were a huge hit.\n\nThis is a must got to restaurant a true culinary experience. There are people who have complained about price being expensive. This restaurant should be Michelin rated the food is worth the price and not what you would say overpriced. Highly recommend"", 'Meh. Overpriced and inconsistent food. The food was not bad but some dishes were just blah. While the soup and pasta were amazing the remaining 3 dishes were bland.\nAlso portions fairly small and prices on expensive side given the size.\nAlso the cheapest glass of red was $16 which I find ridiculous given its Greenpoint.', ""The only thing better than the food is their service.. and their dry Riesling. Ya won't be disappointed"", ""This seemed like a great place for a date, but the crew that I brought was largely disappointed. The food was really good and well thought out. The squash appetizer, rudabega soup and chicken in particular were excellent - the hostess was attentive and welcoming, and it seemed like the cocktails were very interesting, although I didn't have one. I'm a beer guy, and I know this is probably not the place to go for craft beer, but the draft selection was lacking.\nWhat disappointed my group was that Madre is extremely expensive. We know that places like this are expensive but this seemed excessive for the amount of food we got. Probably would have been better if I had just taken my fiancee.\nIn summary, if you want very good food and don't mind shelling out and/or a limited beer selection, give Madre a shot."", 'The oysters here are like crack. They are so fresh and tasty.  We drove all the way from NJ to Brooklyn and happen to get  lucky and find this spot.\n\nWe went for brunch and then drove back the following weekend for dinner. Great, chill place with great food.', 'Returned of our 2nd visit since 5 months ago. This time was at a Sunday dinner after the busy New Year season. One would think a new eatery would fall off its initial high quality after its big bang start in 2019!!! To our surprise, its management and chef continued its pursuance of high standard of quality in food & service.\n\nMy review this time is about the services we received from initial front check-in to the post dinner survey by the manager, Jose Carlos.\n\nWith us arrived and hold for a quick table setup, we were greeted with attentiveness on coat check. Then arrived our hostess, Georgia, a bright smile pleasantness that started our evening.\n\nWe decided to have Georgia in creating the evening menu for 5 of us in celebrating a birthday.\n\nContinued with its complement soup in opening our palate, next comes 2 different fresh salads.\n\nStarted off with a dozen New Brunswick oysters, followed by 3 appetizers: scallops, croquettes, japanese squash & octopus. We were served with 3 main entrees, grilled chicken (PERFECTION MOIST!!!), cap ribeye steak (melted in mouth perfect) & a fish dish!\n\nWhile the food were served, both Georgia and other staff kept attending us with changing plates and utensils.\n\nAt the tail end to our dinner, we were pretty stuffed with all the great dishes. Georgia & the pastry chef continued surprise us with their famous souffle (Concord grape) + a range of sweets to a perfect dinner.\n\nThroughout our dinner, Georgia continued of her charming smile in interacting with us, which made the dinner experience more charming!\n\nLast, their operating manager, Jose Carlos stopped by to survey on our experience and satisfaction of the evening; which emphasized their focus on customer experience and satisfaction.\n\nTo such end of great services, I like to continue give them my 5 stars review in addition of the great quality of food!', 'Came across this new place with many rave reviews of a French, Japanese American influenced cuisine. Each dish serves average for 2 people (Not Chinatown portion!)\n\nStarted with $1 happy hour New Brunswick fresh Oysters complimented with great sweet vinaigrette mignonette sauce.\n\nWe ordered grill Octopus, Eggplant agnolotti & Hamachi to share. The plating is pleasant with colorful sauces with flavors orchestrated like a symphony with its main ingredient.\n\nIn between, chef ""Brian"" complemented us with addition Red Shrimp (prawn) tempura style and gazpacho which turned our simple 3 course meal into a tasty 5 courses meal.\n\nAs we are drawing to the end, we decided to venture into their dessert menu. To much of our surprise, they have strawberry Souffle. We ordered one to share, it came out beautifully raised, fluffy middle with berries in the bottom.\n\nFurther, they complimented us with another Mast Brother chocolate mousse with sea salts.\n\nOur bill including with 2 glasses of wine was $121.00, it is a great value in my humble opinion. Chef Brian executed such quality food using quality fresh ingredients with his great imagination of flavors.', ""Madre!\n\nWe stumbled upon Madre accidentally - we were on a mission to get falafel.

They've been open a whopping 5 weeks at this point so I'm glad we got in when we did... while that new car smell is still in the air.

I just wish they had more wines by the glass... I'm not a big drinker, but I do enjoy a glass of red with my meat.

My favorite dish of the dinner.\n\nPork belly: even people who don't appreciate pork belly will love this, because it's not too fatty, and deliciously crisp.\n\nCeviche (can't remember which type): just a spoonful, but very good.\n\nVegetarian melted cheese: I wish we had chosen the meat tasting menu, because it would have beautifully complemented this dish, which was great even by itself.\n\nOctopus: the sauce was tasty, but the octopus itself very bland.\n\nBrussel sprouts: awesome. They came in a sweet sauce with grapes and were truly memorable.\n\nMerluzzo fish (not sure) in white wine sauce: super flavorful. Loved the sauce so much I wanted to lick the dish.\n\nFried fish: the weak dish of the dinner. The fish itself was too heavy and not particularly memorabl; and it made me a little nauseous.\n\nChurros: delicious.\n\nPan con chile and chocolate: not my thing, but it's just a matter of taste. Many people don't like the combo of tastes, so maybe they should choose a different dessert.\n\nSpicy chocolate bites: the bite from God you want to have to end a dinner in style.\n\nOverall, an amazing deal. Not everything was delicious, but the price makes it for the imperfections. Totally worth another trip, also because the service was awesome, very professional, and the place itself is very cute.\n\nMy second time was epic. My gf and I were served 15 dishes, this time meat-oriented: most of them were much bigger than just tastes.\n\nChips with cheese and hot sauce: simple, but tasty.\n\nShrimp ceviche: kinda tasteless.\n\nGordita with goat meat: fabulous.\n\nDuck wrapped in lettuce: deliciuos\n\nFoie gras: unreal; truly memorable; never had anything like it.\n\nLamb tongue: so tender it could melt in your mouth.\n\nMeatballs: yummy.\n\nCorn soup: ok.\n\nSweetbreads: together with the ceviche, the only dish that wasn't up to the level of everything else.\n\nOctopus: very tasty.\n\nBraised short rib: amazingly soft, and wonderfully complemented by the tortilla-based spread.\n\nPork belly: fantabulous.\nflan with raspberry sauce: the perfect dessert to change and revive the palate; delicate, light and refreshing.\n\nChurros: fluffy and perfectly fried.\n\nChile chocolate: great closure to an outstanding meal.\n\nWe were absolutely stuffed, but as happy as we could be.

I've never actually been inside (Covid), but it looks cute and they're always crazy nice and smiley when I stop by.\n\nSidenote: I made the mistake of ordering online thinking it would be easier for them, but you still need to wait in the line, and they probably lost money on the deal, so don't do that."", ""Delicious authentic Lebanese food, good service.

The warm veg bowl is my go-to as well, and even their homemade croissants are incredible, especially the zaatar one.  I love that the owners are often present and are so friendly and engaging.

The sandwiches were delivious--oh yeah, I definitely ate took a few bites from my gf's cheese-egg wich. The buns had a high density of sesame seeds.\n\n+ Smoked Salmon Sandwich: It's like lox or sushi-grade salmon. It was garnished with dill, capers and some crème fraîche. All of this was piled nicely on 2 nicely toasted slices of some custom-like bread. Though, $17 bucks is quite pricey. Could've thrown on a few more slices of salmon. :D\n\nCONS:\n- nada: To be quite honest, I think we found my new breakfast-morning spot. The front is where you order and 2 small tables for 2 parties can be squeezed in. The interior kitchen and register is really narrow. The main seating is in the backyard. Entering to the seating area in the back is like walking into your own backyard. The screen door really makes you have that impression.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nGreat outdoor space in the backyard during the Spring or Fall. If you're in Greenpoint on the weekend and want some breakfast, it's a great place to go. Note: I will always get breakfast on Saturdays/Sundays and there are 5 places that I have gone to, they include Bakeri (food-awesome, space-awesone), Esme (delicious, decent prices, relatively more crowded) and Franklin Corner Cafe (overpriced--food not good). These restaurants I have mentioned are within 5-8 blocks of each other and nearly encompass all the options for breakfast with exception of 3-4 that I haven't mentioned (Milk & Roses [north Greenpoint, pricey, prejudice french bartender making fun of a hispanic worker; he was french], Eagle Trading Company [low-key, british-dude owned, further north in Greenpoint])."", ""Sandwich | Coffee | Outdoor Space\n\nSandwiches:  Cafe Alula has a variety of sandwiches, from falafel to shawarma.  I had the smoked salmon sandwich. It came with lettuce, tomatoes, and pickled onions.  It was significantly larger than I anticipated.  I was more than full after I had the sandwich.  Making it a great value at $14.\n\nCoffee:  The second highlight of Cafe Alula is there a variety of coffee options.  They have everything from cold brew, to espresso shots, to lattes, to mochas.  I had an espresso shot which was spot on.\n\nOutdoor space:  When there is a nice day, Alula has a great outdoor space in the back.  It has room for about 30 people.  There are a lot of plants and greenery around which definitely gives you a lift on your mood during your lunch.\n\nPro Tip:  Don't let the storefront fool you, it is good."", ""~Monica's T.A.S.T.E. Test~\n\nTaste: I ordered the falafel pita which was stuffed with delicious falafel, pickled onions/cucumbers, hummus and more. The pita was firm and held up well to the stuffing inside.

A little short on space but we were able to get a table for 3. Very cute inside and out.\n\nService: The meals were delivered promptly and fresh. Usually you bus your own table and get your own water, but our waitress was kind enough to do it for us.\n\nTab: $12-20 sandwiches/breakfasts which was cheaper than some of the surrounding areas in Brooklyn, especially for the quality that came out.\n\nExtra wow factor: I loved the options on the menu.

I'm not a meat eater and I had to try two slices w meat. The four cheese is delicious. Sooo good. At the moment, no liquor license so it's BYOB.\n\nThe crust is low gluten and super thin and light. You can eat a personal pie, no problem."", 'Dough Vale is neighborhood hidden gem. Its off the beaten path but its an incredible local find. And if you love good authentic Italian pizza - its the best i have had in New York!\n\nTo start, we must begin with the people! The restaurant is owned and run by the Chef - Giuseppe. A born and raised Sicilian who started working in pizza shops in Sicily when he was 13 yrs old. He does it all! He makes the dough, the pizza/pasta sauce, all the way to the salad dressing. Its all home made and you can taste the love and care he puts into the details and the flavors. He is a generous man with his time and his big heart. When you do see other people in the place working - its the local neighborhood students who he is training! Its so nice to be in a pizza place the gives the neighborhood kids an oppt to make a little money. Thats such a blessing. Anyone else you see in there working - its his Italian family and close friends. If you ask Giuseppe - all his customers are beautiful people with so much love in their hearts. He loves his customers and you can feel it the moment he greets you. He knows them all well. Ive had the pleasure to experience the inner beauty of his customers because i have eaten here probably 15 times. You see people of all ages, races, gender, occupations, languages, etc. everyone has a story and is a human being. The people make the ambience and it feels really good to be here.\n\nOn the food - its 5 stars. Lets begin with the pizza. I think its important to note that Giuseppe has spent 1,000s of hours perfecting his dough. There is so much love, thought and passion put into it - thats why the restaurant has Dough in the name. He pairs that dough reference in the name with ""Vale"". Vale is the perfect pairing because it refers to the most important love in his life who he has passion, kindness, and endless time for - just ask him about it.\n\nThe dough and pizza sauce are stars in the pizza dishes. i think we have had almost every one of the pieces he serves. We love the sausage, the leah, the piccante, and the margherita. The meat options on the pizza are so delicious and the best quality. The veggies on the pizza (especially eggplant and asparagus) are so fresh and tasty on their own. All the pizzas I have tasted are good though. The dough is thin and crispy and you feel light after you eat it. Thats why we keep coming back - hands down the lightest airy dough that doesnt weigh you down. No food coma after you eat here!!!\n\nOh the salads - never have I met a pizza man who makes such great salads. They are large too which I like. The toppings with each lettuce option are so carefully considered and constructed. The cheeses on the salads are amazing. I love cheese and you can taste that the cheese is top quality.\n\nPasta - they are a big hit here and I see many people ordering them. We have had a few and each one has been unique, flavorful, and served at the perfect temperature.\n\nOnce you start coming here - you will be here every week! The food, ambience, and the people will keep bringing you back and wanting more.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nI cant seem to find a place on my yelp profile to put my description of how I review restaurants so please see below:\n\nMy partner and I are food lovers and we both cook restaurant quality food. We absolutely appreciate great food and we especially focus on fresh ingredients, local as much as possible, and we love farm to table. Because of this, when we do go out to eat, we value the experience as much as the food. Our favorite experiences are when we feel like a guest in someones home / kitchen. The people that work there also have very low staff turnover - like a family kitchen. We dont write many reviews and we tend to write them only when we have been there many times. Also while we can appreciate the high end Michelin star restaurants, they have many reviews already so we dont focus on them.', ""POSITIVES +\n* love how this is a family owned place. My boyfriend and I got to chat with the owners and learned how much they loved this place so much.\n* dough for the pizza  is extremely fresh! It's soft and chewy. Eat it quickly right out of the oven! It's really good\n* although this place was small, my boyfriend and I had an amazing experience being there.

I also got the pork hash and I highly recommend this, its got a great combination of textures- crispy pork, round hominy, pickled jalapenos and pickled onions. Comes with a poached egg on top and makes for a fantastic breakfast. I asked for a side of a dulce de leche butter and I recommend that everyone gets this cos its simply fabulous. Get a pancake or something to put it on as well.\n\nMy friends tried the granola and yogurt- which was really thick and very much a meal since I think they hung out some greek yogurt, and also the sandwich with  avocado scrambled egg and chorizo- this is really spicy and I can handle my spice, so watch it if this is your order. That being said, it was super delicious.\n\nGreat little space, good waitstaff and clean bathrooms.

A friend wanted me to go here with her a while back, but I objected because I thought I wouldn't be a fan of the cuisine. I prefer a greasy spoon, Southern brunch. However, I ended up giving in this time and enjoyed my meal. I ordered the pancakes with dulce de leche butter and maple syrup, along with scrambled eggs. This meal also came with chorizo or roasted pork, but the friendly waiter told me I could swap the meat for a side of avocados! (Muchas gracias for accommodating the non-meat eater). There was minor confusion with our order because my friend ordered a side of one pancake to go along with her Plato Ecuatoriano, but when the food came out, they gave me 1 pancake instead of two and my friend received none. When my friend explained the mix up to a waiter, the chef walked over and asked to hear what went wrong. He quickly went back into the kitchen and brought out my friend's pancake and an additional one for me to complete my pancake stack order. He was very apologetic and checked back in on us to make sure we had a pleasant experience. Great service! Thanks for making us happy customers. I'll be back soon!"", ""I've been here a few times for breakfast and lunch and really enjoy their food!

The chicken was on point, the cheese was on point, and the guava -- MY GOODNESS!!!!\n\nOkay, now let's get into the restaurant as a whole. It's a quaint little spot that's nestled on Nostrand, close to Sterling. We stumbled upon Colina Cuervo on a snow day while we were in town and it was the best unplanned lunch. There was a bit of a wait when we entered in and I'm not sure if it was due to the snow or because it's just that good BUT after our experience, I'm going to say it's a little bit of both.\n\nOnce we were seated, our hostess offered to get me a chair with a back for my daughter -- which was a plus for me. It's hard enough traveling around with a young child sometimes but the fact that she took notice was so appreciated.\n\nAs for our lunch, I ordered the lentil soup and a chicken empanada with the hibiscus lemonade. I ordered two guava empanadas and a hot chocolate for my MiniMe. The first thing I noticed about our orders is that the portion sizes were to die for! It seemed like that lentil soup was bottomless -- which was great for a snowy day. The hibiscus lemonade had the right amount of tart to make for a refreshing beverage. I already talked about the empanadas but I'll say it again -- THE BEST!\n\nOur meal was so tasty that we came back the very next day for round 2.\n\nNext time we're in BK, you know where we'll be stopping!"", ""Colina's is the go-to spot located in the up and coming Crown heights neighborhood.

I love this place. 1st off really cool place to have a business, in the Industrial Center. We got two different sandwiches that they were providing today. The roast beef and the Italian. Blue eyes asked me how I wanted it, I told him,""I want it exactly the way you\'d eat it."" Incredible! And the peppers were so hot. I\'m so happy with everything, even down to the clean ambience, and of course the service. If I\'m ever back in NYC, I\'m coming back to this place. +We loved that they have treats/bones just for animals. So we bought some treats for our pup. I\'m sure he\'ll love them. TYSVM. &Stay safe.', ""Industry city. MEAT. Got both the roast beef and the Italian sandwich. Both were delicious but I liked the roast beef more. The staff were two really friendly guys who were talking about how they butcher the meat, the farm they get the meat from, etc. I take a star off because.. well they toasted my bread, and I didn't ask for it to be toasted, and it came out burnt. I ate the sandwich, was still delicious but I was frustrated they didn't ask how I would like the bread, and assumed. I really don't love burnt bread! But the meat and fillings were fresh and the price actually wasn't terrible! I would definitely return, and make sure to ask that the bread not be toasted(if I get a sandwich)! I would also buy their meat; it all looked great. Support local!"", 'After having a terrible experience at a previous sandwich shop, I honestly was too scared to try another sandwich shop again.\n\nBut, Ends Meat. They restored my faith in good sandwiches in the world.\n\nAt first, I thought this place was a butcher shop given the name and appearance of the store. But nope, they sell delicious lunch menu options!\n\nRight off the bat, I was greeted with friendliness by the men working there. I decided on the Bacon and Pate Sandwich ($12), which had Mortadella, mayo, pork, kimchi, red onion, and cilantro.\n\nKimchi, pork, and mayo were right up my alley so I played safe. But upon taking a bite, I honestly was blown away at how good it actually was. The cilantro, the crunchiness of the kimchi with the pork and Mortadella, made it seem like I was eating a Korean fusion Bahn Mi.\n\nBest sandwich ever. I miss it already.\nI would go back and dare myself to try other options next time!', ""Whoa, let's just say I had the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. Seriously.\n\nThe meat was amazing, the bread (which they make in house) was perfect and toasty. And whatever the sauce was, just perfectly paired and tasty. Provolone was an exceptional compliment. I was so impressed that even the shredded iceberg sent my taste buds on an adventure.\n\nWill be back. Almost bought all the meat to go home but had to control myself."", ""We read all the reviews about the beef neck sandwich -- and it was indeed very good. Price was slightly steep considering brooklyn, but considering the wannabe tourist-ness of industry city i guess its acceptable. The portion was quite substantial, i'd have to say. Do get the hot sauce they have on the counter because it adds a nice touch!\n\nOh we also got these dog-snack looking slimjim-looking things and it was not good i do not recommend."", 'So after many times eating sandwiches, I finally came for the meat itself. I got a pound of dry aged ground beef for burgers and a side of kimchi just because. The dry aged ground beef made some of THE BEST burgers I have possibly EVER had! Definitely worth it! Will be back to try more of their steak offerings in the days to come. Also, their kimchi is, in my opinion, close to perfect- crunchy, not too spicy- yum.', 'I\'ve been here twice, and sampled two of their delicious sandwiches. My only regret is living in this area for so long before I did so. Oh my gosh, these are the best sandwiches in the borough. (Okay, maybe not? But I haven\'t had anything better or even within striking distance yet.) These are a ""bring-your-foodie-friends-so-they-can-be-green-with-envy"" type of sandwich, piled high with craft meats and toppings. I\'ve had the beefneck and bacon and pate sandwiches, and I\'d be hard pressed to pick a favorite of the two- depends on what mood you\'re in, you know? Staff is extremely helpful too. My second trip I also got some slices of lomo to take home. Can confirm they are also insanely delicious. So if you\'re in the area and need anything meat related- a sandwich, meat, jerky, charcuterie- definitely stop by and prepare to be wowed.', 'Ends meat is the first sandwich shop that I know of which made me want to crawl into a fetal position and fear my mortality.  When a man like me hits a certain age all the medical advisories start to kick in.  \n\n""You should eat less red meat, reduce your saturated fat intake, work out more, and get a prostate exam every year...""\n\nJust like every red blooded American, I enjoy barbecues, charcuterie and practically everything you can do to turn up the flavor volume on the carcass of poultry, steer or swine.  I also like them sold by a jolly knowledgeable butcher with some serious facial hair.\n\nSunset park (the area around the food hall) suffers from an embarrassment of riches when it came to culinary possibilities. It is a neighborhood of new immigrants hailing from Latin America and Southeast China.  There exists a vibrant area with taquerias, carnicerias and dumpling stores all the way from Atlantic center to the edge of Bay Ridge with a ton of small grocery stores / small supermarkets.  However, if you are not familiar with the area you might think that it is a food desert. To experience the culinary splendor of the area you should take the B63 bus from Brooklyn Bridge Park down Atlantic/5th Avenue from Greenwood cemetery all the way to Bay Ridge.  \n\nThe area near Industry City is an alien transplant completely at odds with the surrounding area, with overpriced gourmet eateries trading in the obscure, mostly for people who came off the BQE exit ramp on 38th and 39th.  On one end there is Brooklyn\'s busiest CostCo (hello incline elevator and hordes of Chinese shoppers), and on the other end, a Federal Prison (Metropolitan Detention Complex Brooklyn).  I always find it hilarious that the shopping plaza right next to it facing the detainees is called...LibertyView.  I actually like that place.  I can geek out at Microcenter, the missus at Saks, and both of us can indulge in snackery at World Market.  \n\nOf course, there is that 900 pound gorilla in the mist, which is Industry City.  I am not really sure what it is.  It seems to be a collection of overpriced interior decor shops, a couple of industrial kitchens (for Li-lac chocolate?) and a bunch of slightly overpriced eateries formulated kinda like a food hall, bit the foot traffic seems to be aimed at their relatively overcompensated employees or outsiders - but then I never see massive visitor numbers.  Why open an eatery here?    \n\nTake ends meat, for instance.  They do something similar to, say, Ehmer\'s in Glendale (Queens) or Schnaller & Weber in the Upper East side - they are your cut-to-order butcher who also can provide you with cured meat products - charcuterie, sausages and meat sandwiches.  And in the case of Ends Meat, they also do soups.  Of course, Ehmers/S&W are both on busy streets (Mrytle/2nd Av respectively), while Ends-Meat are inside this trendy, design oriented shopping area, so guess which place have the sleek / vintage store interior and the young butcher with the apron and serious facial hair?  \n\nOf course, you don\'t come here to gawk at the surroundings like some fucking hipster with horn-rim glasses, a Leica M7 around your neck and Airpods blasting Chromeo.  You are here to eat meat unironically.  You will give your sandwich a girl\'s name, because you will facefuck it vigorously and willingly, emanating sounds that would need a funky, bass heavy 70s porno soundtrack to do it justice.  No more eating out Oscar Meyer Mondalez through its purty corporate shrinkwrap, it\'s time to step up to the 36 chambers of Atherosclerosis.  When you are done, you will think back at the fatty flavorful meat product you just consumed, think about how much saturated fat and chloresterol you just ingested, look at all those lithe millenials walking through the food hall who would no doubt outlive you, look back at yourself, and despair.  I know I did.  Please, if there is a merciful god, strike down those millenials and let me get another round on that sandwich. Oh, that tender meaty goodness, the crispy but soft bread with its jelly or juices drippling down my chin.  I have become death, destroyer of meaty goodness.  \n\nBut seriously, get the beefneck sandwich.  That is some seriously tender flavorful meaty goodness right there.', ""This place is amazing! My favorite spot inside IC\n\nIt was the beefneck sandwich that got me and the rest is history. I stumbled into this place looking around for lunch and I am so glad I walked in here. Maybe it was the allure of all the hanging cured meats, the pickled veggies, or hype over this amazing beefneck sandwich, maybe it was all the above! regardless, I am forever committed to the delicious offerings here at Ends Meat.\n\nThe beefneck sandwich was love at first bite. Juicy tender beef, the slics of beef neck melts in your mouth, the sweet caramelized onions, the cheddar cheese, and pickles that cut the rich fatty sandwich. The bread that comes fresh from a local bakery was so good I had to ask where it came from. Aside from the sandwich, we also had to try all the cured meats thats offered, and after much deliberation, they were super nice and offered to do a sampler meat board.

It's a small intimate place that was great for the party. This place opens for dinner only 6pm, but during the day is rental for special parties.\n\nThere were long communal tables and the bar is at the back of the restaurant. The host of the party decorated the place beautifully with the Bee theme. The restaurant served buffet style at the bar counter. There were 2 appetizers: chicken with blue cheese mousse + baked puree chickpea. The brunch menu was their famous nutella french toast (with yogurt, granola, syrup on side for topping), mini beef sliders, a baked egg dish with red cabbage on it, and a salad that had croutons and very thin slices of boiled eggs (wasn't enough eggs and dressing so it was a dry salad). I grab a little food as consideration for the people behind me in line (I was the 3rd person on line to get food). I did go back for a second plate to get more salad and 1 more slider and there was no more eggs in the salad.\n\nOnly 1 unisex bathroom (no baby changing  area in their for a family/kid friendly place) and lighting was super dimmed in there that you can't see well.\n\nOverall, party was a success because of the service, food was okay, and the host's decors and energy! But I wouldn't come back here to eat as it didn't wow me. Maybe for special event menu is not as great as dinner? Also, there were pitchers of water on tables but never refilled until we flagged the staff. Was only 1 staff who set up food, bussed plates and served drinks at the bar. But I wasn't impressed, I heard some people were still hungry with it being only 3 hot food + 1 salad for buffet.

They were kind enough to allow us to decorate the interior with a simple backdrop for photography purposes (hung with command hooks for easy removal). We were also able to decorate the tables with our own DIY succulents.\n\nThe menu consisted of a variety of brunch items including but not limited to Egg Sandwiches, Fresh Fruit Salad, Nutella French Toast, Buttermilk Fried Chicken (resembled tenders) with Polenta, a Deconstructed Salad - requested ahead of the event, and Fresh Fruit Tarts.

It may sound weird that it has peanut butter sauce in it but it's really good and not sweet at all.\n\nSweet potato fries (5/5): Maybe my favorite appetizers because it's not burnt and it's really smooth and delicious.\n\nShakshuka: (4.5/5) The second shakshuka is a bit spicy but their eggs are on point.

Barano has become one of my boyfriends and I favorite restaurants. I could go on and on about the food. The pizza might be my favorite (but its hard to say). What I love about the menu is the seasonal changes and diversity of the offerings. I have recently starting taking clients of mine from Manhattan to Brooklyn to experience the food.  Service is also incredible, everyone is incredibly knowledgeable and obviously know the menu well. Last but certainly not least Barano has amazing ambiance from the lighting to the decor. I will continue making this a local! :)', ""Every visit to Barano has been an absolute treat. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and seemingly love what they're doing.\n\nWe always order the pork ribs, they are SO good and good size per dish. We love the saffron gigli, it's such an interesting combination of flavors but amazing. The pizzas are always solid, my fiancé loves the 'Nduja pizza.\n\nThe cocktails are very good, which is a huge plus because not all Italian restaurants focus on their cocktail program but you can tell Barano does. I'm a wine lover but it's nice to have that option for sure.\n\nThe decor is very cool, and while it is usually full it's never too loud. We haven't sat outside yet but would love to soon!\n\nWhat prompted my review was the delivery we ordered the other night. It's no secret it's not a good time for the restaurant industry right now, yet Barano has kept business going through a great delivery menu.\n\nI love to order online, but calling in was a breeze, they were super friendly and eager to serve. What amazed us was the quality didn't change. It's always best when dining in but seriously it was just as great by delivery."", ""Barano has great outdoor seating that is properly social distanced. I got the garlic bread along with the dry aged meatball for apps. The garlic bread was one of the best I've ever had. It was almost like a mini garlic pizza if that makes sense but it was very good. The meatball was very tender and the sauce was very good but it was cold and I thought that was a little weird. I got the saffron pasta: very unique. It was a cheesy, hint of spicy, and sweet pasta. I would definitely recommend and my husband got the tagatelle which had a bolognese sauce and he loved it. The food was prepared promptly and service was great!"", ""I've been here a few times with family or a friend and I have to say that every time I have not been disappointed. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Their drinks and mock-tails and wine selection is superb! The food is top notch. Even something so simple as home fries can be turned into the most amazing thing you've ever eaten (get that during brunch).\n\nThe interior ambiance is lovely. A bit dark in the evenings but the candles on the tables are helpful. The waitresses have a pretty vast knowledge of the wines in case they're out of what you would have liked a glass of.\n\nThe restaurant is super clean and never had an issue with dust or other allergens. The bathrooms are gorgeous. I'd recommend using the sink outside of the restrooms just because you won't have any door handles and locks to shift around after washing up. The soap smells great too.\n\nThe seats are fairly comfortable. I sat in the booth area recently and you do tend to fall back as opposed to leaning forward. Maybe a suggestion of easy to clean cushions is something that should be looked into.\n\nKitchen looks clean too.\n\nHonestly no complaints, good vibes, and good feedback.\n\nHappy eats!"", ""Barano was excellent. My boyfriend and I made a reservation for a Saturday night fairly easily. This spot is quite a walk from the train, but that's one of my only complaints.\n\nI started with the Party on, Wayne mocktail - all of their drinks were SNL themed in January. We then shared the little gem salad, saffron gigli and Cavatelli, plus the cannoli and torta caprede for dessert.\n\nStandouts were the little gem, Cavatelli and desserts. The gigli was actually not my favorite; I found it a bit sweet. Definitely don't skip dessert - torta in particular was so rich.\n\nNext time: I need to try the pizza!

The staff is beyond accommodating and so nice, from the hostess Vivian, to our amazing waiter Conrad, to the wonderful owner/chef Al. Side note - he used to work at Rubirosa which is sad for Rubirosa\'s sake since Barono\'s pizza is 50x better.\n\nDish-wise - gluten free vodka pizza and gluten free white labneh pizza are amazing. Must get the hot bombay sauce with them. Next time I go back I\'ll try the other 2 gf pizzas.\n\nSaffron da Gigli pasta is insane and so is the rigatoni - both gluten free. On the rigatoni, extra pecorino will really bring out the flavor to a truly elite level.\n\nSkirt steak was superb awesome flavor.\n\nBrussel sprout salad and gem salad to start were delicious.\n\nBranzino was good but the only dish that didn\'t wow us.  \n\nDesserts were outstanding - the torta is gluten free which was the best. Vegan ice cream also amazing and the other ice cream thing we got too. They also sent something special out for my mom which was all class, great touch.\n\nOverall, I\'m really not sure why this restaurant doesn\'t skyrocket to the top of the list when you google ""gluten free restaurants in nyc"" or just best restaurants in NYC.

There is no shortage of Thai places bordering Fort Greene Park, especially concentrated within a few blocks on Myrtle. Although I haven't tried them all, Thai Holic is definitely hard to beat.\n\nThe fact that their lunch special is available on the weekends is an absolute game changer, and that in addition to the ease of their online ordering process makes it an easy weekend go-to. For $9, you can get an appetizer and a main. I ordered the chive pancakes and the fresh ginger main, which included onion, scallion, carrot, long hot chili, mushroom, Chinese celery, and red bell peppers. The lunch portion was pretty generous, which a very solid serving of chicken (sometimes lunch portions skimp on protein, but that was not the case here!). The ginger in this dish was perfectly balanced with a black bean sauce that the vegetables were cooked in -- it had the perfect amount of spice without being overpowering with the ginger flavor. The order came with an entire carton of steamed rice, which was, again, generous portioning.\n\nWhile the main was good, the chive pancakes absolutely stole the show. The chive pancakes were unlike any sort of scallion pancake or similar appetizer that I had ever gotten -- rather than a dough-heavy, flat pancake, these were triangular nuggets of almost pure chives. They were very lightly breaded, and were fried to crispy perfection. They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, which took them to another level.\n\nI cannot wait to go back to Thai Holic for more chive pancakes and to try a few of their other entrees!"", ""We popped into this lovely restaurant on Saturday evening. We were sat down immediately. There was also parking directly across the street and we did not have to pay the meter because it was after 7 PM. Win/win situation.\n\nI ordered a crab topped rice.

I've never had sake, but I ordered a drink called the Avatar and it was pretty delicious. There isn't much seating inside right now, and it is on a first come first served basis.

The stellar ownership, turnaround improvement and performance has led me back here to tell you Yelpers all about it! Since my last review, the owner reached out to me about my review (which has never happened before), which shows this establishment truly cares about their consumers satisfaction and/or dissatisfaction of their service and/or food. That was impressive and made me give it another try!\nI went for the same appetizers, another regular Thai entree and a specialized menu Thai Holic item. I could NOT tell you this was the same place I wrote the same review about the first time. I am still awed about the food I had! I could not stop being wowed, by every bite and every taste bud being exploded by the flavor being introduced. It lacked nothing from the first time and passed everything with flying colors than expected! Truly I am impressed it was phenomenal. The Chicken Curry Puffs were absolutely delicious the aromatic flavors and chicken were flavorful in every bite you could taste it! The Holic Wings and Holic Crispy Roll were precisely perfected from the last time! The Holic Crispy Roll especially the tip wasn't empty, the batter were perfect the shrimp was right there when you bit it the sauce was just what you needed! I just can't believe how STILL impressed I am! The Basil Fried Rice and Pad See Ew (both with Chicken & Shrimp) were especially great! The noodles were broad and saucy just the way it's supposed to be or how I like it! Soy and sweet in all the right places! Nothing was bland at all, the spices were all together and the flavor was there, right where you needed it to be. Now, the special menu item was the Salmon Panang. Fish can be so hard to keep flavorful especially in sauce, where it's easy to escape but Thai Holic you perfected it and I have to say that was entree of the night! The salmon was tender and flavorful. The sauce was just right, not too runny and not too thick. Perfect with the consistency of a bisque and/or gravy, to pour over your jasmine rice. You really took the opportunity to improve and took the cake. This is a business that takes their customers satisfaction seriously and I am happy to be their customer and happy for them. See you again soon!"", ""I see that this place has a lot of great reviews which was what made me try it in addition to a recommendation. I usually always go with Yelp. I have to say I was highly dissatisfied with both my appetizer and entree. We ordered the Holic Wings, Holic Crispy Rolls, Druken Noodles and Fresh Ginger with Shrimp and Brown Rice. The Holic Wings were tasty I can say which why I appointed 3 stars instead of 2 but that's about it. The rest of the food was less than mediocre and distasteful because it was bland; lacking a whole lot of flavor Thai food should have without relying on the spice. Holic Crispy Rolls were a good attempt but were fried too hard and hard at the tip. The dipping sauces made it appealing. My entree, Fresh Ginger with Shrimp and Brown Rice was honestly, terrible. It was swimming in broth and I've had this entree at other Thai restaurants and this is to no comparison. It was not swimming in broth, not that that much liquid, the ginger was overpowering and that was NOT brown rice. My boyfriend's entree, Druken Noodles was just as bland he did not enjoy it. I would say giving it another chance but this was recent, during a pandemic, no rushing to wait tables or fulfill numerous orders at once. I say this is one to say I may have to skip for good.""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-holic-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Flavors are very homecook style, basil chicken is one of our favs. Also gotten the more traditional Cantonese style foods like wonton noodles, beef stew noodles, & some rice dishes, most things are delicious. Their scallion pancakes are the Cantonese kind, so they're much thinner and smaller than the Northern Chinese kind.\n\nTip: don't expect their Thai style noodles (aka Pad Thai) to be completely Thai flavors, it's a mimick of Thai flavors.\n\nAlso they don't separate broth in take out when you order noodles in soup, which is a bit downside to me because most noodles can soak up the soup during delivery.

So affordable, filling and so so good. In terms of noodle soup, the house special mama's noodle soup is flavorful but light. You get to choose your choice of noodles. The options are stated on the menu. My other favorite noodle soup option would be the Tom yum noodle soup and the curry noodle soup. It was a little odd they served pad Thai, Tom yum and other Thai options in a mainly Cantonese noodle shop but the Tom Yum was surprisingly delicious. Mama's noodle house offers bags of frozen dumplings for sale. The fried pork dumpling appetizer was really yummy when I ordered it and so buying a frozen bag of them seemed like a good move.\n\nNormally, the small restaurant would offer sit down and you can serve yourself hot or cold water with condiments such as soy sauce and red vinegar on the table.

It comes topped with fresh scallions and cilantro. Some reviews mentioned it was overwhelmingly spicy, but you can adjust as long as you tell whoever is taking your order. I could eat the sauce by itself too honestly. There's shrimp in every wonton, it paired perfectly with the sauce. The filling was so good I would definitely order it again.\n\nFried dumplings were okay, would recommend the wontons over it. Your average fried dumplings that are decently sized. Some places give small ones but mama's was average/a little bigger.\n\nVery mixed feelings about the minced pork noodles. Some reviews said the noodles got soggy very fast and that was the case for my order. Couldn't finish it because the consistency was very mushy but probably my fault because I could've asked to change the type of noodles.

May order this again but with different noodles so it doesn't get soggy fast.\n\nMama house special noodles was also loaded with ingredients! Soy sauce braised egg was flavorful.

Often times, the staff genuinely inquires about your meal and I think the managers or owners come up to you and chat about life and what's going on in the world. I truly value the time they take to speak to each customer individually and offer an experience you don't find often in a big city like NYC.\n\nAnd obviously onto the food, my go-to item here is the Eggplant Roll. The dough is ridiculous. The eggplant is perfect. And the cheese is insane. Everything put together so simply but so elegantly and the size is perfect for a couple of people to share as an appetizer, or if you're really hungry, take it straight to the face with some marinara sauce (I like to put parmesan in my marinara).\n\nThank you for everything you do and I hope we get through these rough times."", ""I've loved their pizza for a while, but I'm writing this now because I'm blown away with their customer service.

Our order was not ready when we got there but the staff were very friendly. When I received the box, I realized there's a closer location in my neighborhood that was a 3 minute drive! I was very impressed with their vodka pie that it became our new norm go to pie. The cheese to vodka sauce ratio was perfect and topping it with basil gave it the nice kick. Well basil on anything is amazing.

I thought that this place was really great, from the service to the actual pizza. This is definitely one of the best pizza spots in Brooklyn.

For any brick-oven pizza fan, this is a great, low-key spot.\n\nDiavola Pizza: The crust was thin, but not paper thin, and covered in fresh and tasty ingredients. The crust was cooked to perfection, crunchy on the outside, with some fluffiness inside. I usually don't like olives on pizza because they are usually too tart and overpowering, but they went really nicely on this pizza; I enjoyed them on this pizza.

The pies come out quick, and the servers have a fantastically conversational and authentic nature about them that I really loved. Star.\n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\n$18.95 got me a small half and half, which was of course massive and could have probably covered three meals. Good value. Star.\n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nLike Juliana's, I gravitated towards the white half of this pie even though both halves were excellent. The cheeses came together brilliantly, the pepperonis came through, and like at Juliana's, my only complaint was that the crust didn't quite match the inherit flavor that you find at Roberta's, which in my mind is the queen of Brooklyn pizza.

A bit acidic from the strawberry, then a smooth lightly floral jasmine. Pricey but sooo delicious (4.5/5)\n2) Arrostocini (Italian Lamb Skewer) from D\'Abryzzo: A simple lamb skewer from Abruzzo. It\'s a very simple dish, lamb on a stick. There is a bit of gaminess but the flavor is almost sweet and there\'s so much delicious browning and char but the meat is still extremely tender and you can taste the rendered fat that they layer between. It\'s not something I necessarily want a ton of but it\'s a nice street food (4.25/5)\n3) Tacos de Birria w/ Consomme from Chofi Birria: Really flavorful meat and broth. I prefer birria with a touch more vinegar but the smokey chiles and beefy flavor is nice. Tortilla was a bit tough for me but love the flavor (4/5)\n4) Carbonara Donut from Pop Pasta: The only item I disliked during my visit. It\'s not good in any way. I get they\'re trying to do something like the ramen burger but it is fully for the gram and nothing about it is good as actual food. It is the shaped, congealed cousin of the carbonara you left in the back of your fridge. It is oily and flavorless with the exception of the bacon on top. I had to get one ""instagrammable"" item while I was here and I fell into the trap. (0/5)\n5) Sandes de Leitão (Suckling pig w/ black pepper sauce, fresh arugula. sheep\'s milk cheese) from Leitao: The heaviest item I got. Definitely a small meal in itself. Tons of succulent pig that will just break away in your mouth with very little effort. Nice peppery sauce and arugula help lighten it up and the sheep\'s milk cheese gives it a final blast of tangy flavor. It\'s a bit heavy but good (4.25/5)\n6) Fig Thyme Kefir & Peach Basil Kefir from Culture Cream: If you like tart frozen yogurt and ice cream, then this is a great option for you. I love the array of refreshing flavors they have and the tanginess is present without being too overwhelming. The ice cream is still creamy but not as fatty in texture as regular ice cream. (4.25/5)\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my visit to Smorgasburg. At one point I had a ton of leftovers and while most places don\'t do takeout boxes, the employees at the front helped me put together a makeshift solution out of plastic bags they had around. Also, a small thing still worth shouting out: I love the location. The view of the water, the breeze, and the spacious area (once you get past the food stalls of course) just make for a much more pleasant experience. I can\'t wait to come back.', ""Loved it here. I went in 2019 for my brothers birthday. I had the ramen burger here along with other tasty things.\n\nIt's best to have a game plan when coming here. You can look at the vendors and potential food items before the event. If you have friends bring them it's a good time for foodie friends to be together.\n\nIf you are going in a group, divide and conquer. Have someone go find a table or spot to sit and lounge at while others go scope out the the food options. If you are going alone places to sit are a dime a dozen so I suggest you bring a chair or get to seat hunting.\n\nBring card but keep your cassh close by. There are a lot of booths that take both but shit happens. There are vendors that solely take cash and others that only take card but sometimes card machines go down and cash becomes king. So if you can hold off on using your cash do so.\n\nThe bathroom situation is terrible, porta potty . That's not to say that they didn't try to be clean. They had a pump sink all of that. People are just gross. Bring wet naps, tissue, hand sanitizer you will thank me. Possibly be prepared to buy a drink at an establishment use a toilet. All the other establishments are on high alert and literally tell you no for the bathroom.\n\nAll and tho it's a good time and there are a lot of markets going on around that time.\n\nGo one day you wont regret it."", ""Went with some friends to check out the Williamsburg Smorgasburg, an event that takes place in the area every Saturday afternoon. We actually saw the smaller version of this event, because it was held indoors on the 8th floor of a building and that was probably due to the cold weather. I've been told that it's usually held outdoors in a much larger space and with many more food vendors.\n\nThe hipster vibe was strong here. We found plenty of vintage vinyl records, clothing, a cluster of vendors with random items and artifacts, and a small section for food vendors.\n\nWe tried most of the food here as there weren't that many. One of my favorites was the crispy flavored balls with varied inner fillings from Petisco Brazuca. The spicy Thai fried Chicken in a pineapple was also tasty and quite spicy. I also enjoyed the Pizza Cupcake which kind of tasted like a Pizza Hut pizza. The Mao's Baos with various meat fillings was also interesting. The Jianbing was what I had higher expectations for. I thought it would've been more tastier than it actually was. I heard the Barbecue Tacos were amazing. I didn't get to try them, but they looked so enticing."", ""My review is for the winter session of this smorgasburg which is at 25 kent ave. We 1st thought it was in the park but since it is winter, it is located on kent and 12th. It's on the 8th floor of this beautiful building. You're told you are only able to use the revolving doors. You can however open the door to use. When you're on the top floor you can see great 360 views of Brooklyn, Queens and the Manhattan skyline.\n\nThere's so many vendors here that I couldn't remember all the names of them so I took a ton of pictures. The best place tho had to be the shop called Louise, because that is my name. ha! No, but all the vendors had some cool items. I especially loved the section of old toys and old street signs. They had a ton of old furniture that I wish I lived nearby to take home.\n\nSome of the clothes were so vintage I just wanted to scream and purchase everything. I found myself saying to my significant and friend over and over wow do you remember these? OR do you remember when we used to wear this. The purses they had were a little more modern but they will run you about $40 to $80. They had some really fun graphic tees. I found it funny that there was a box of old vintage playboys.\n\nThe cost for a lot of the clothes was pretty high but it is expect because of the area. I am sure you can talk some people down if you needed to. There was this old school light from the 80s that had cats on it that you can touch to put on. I remember back in the days everyone had them in their house. I was really shocked at how cool this place was.\n\nI recommend taking off your jacket and leaving it in coat check. This place gets really warm when you walk over the food section. The food prices range from $4 to $20 depending on what you're getting. If you're an apple payer then you get a discount, unfortunately I am not. It can get very smokey in the food section so if you have a sensitively to smells there is a section that I noticed you can't get the smoke in your eyes.\n\nI tried the pizza cupcake which was delicious it was two of them for $7.00 with a $1.50 dipping sauce by The Pizza cupcake. There was these delicious empanadas $3 for $10 made by Petisco Brazuca. They were so good and the beef was delicious. I think it only comes with meat because the sauce that was given was cheese. They also had this vegan spot called Valentine that made this phenomenal mac and cheese.\n\nOkay, this might be everyone's favorite part but they had free samples. Free samples of whiskey. Coppers Daughters is the name of the drink we sampled in 4 different flavors. I'm basic so the not so basic flavor was the best because it was pumpkin. But the other two flavors Thai Basil and Black current is my favorite. One of them tasted like wine I can't remember which one. The cost of the bottle was between $32 and $40 wasn't too bad but you can find a bigger bottles of something cheaper if you're on a budget.\n\n:::BATHROOM ALERT::\nThis bathroom was just ok. It was not dirty or anything I just felt that it was an inconvenience if you had a child. There do not have a baby changing station here. The water fountain is next to the bathroom. I do like that the stalls completely close so you don't have that awkward moment of someone looking at you thru the cracks.\n\nThe best tip I can give you is that you need to find a table if you're with a group. If you don't then you will be standing up and eating your food holding your jacket and hoping you don't spill anything. Check your coat, find a seat and get your food. Definitely check out the whole entire space because you will find some rare items here. No one here was rude everyone seemed very friendly.\n\nI will find myself back here in a couple of weeks. There are a lot of things that I want to try. The BBQ and the dumplings look so promising. I want to kick myself because I wanted to try it but I limited myself because I did not want to overeat.\n\nIf you live in LiC you're in luck the B32 home is right on the corner."", 'Fun ""outdoor food court"" with so many options that everyone is bound to find something to satisfy! I opted to get these sushi tacos (I think that\'s the best way to describe them?? Do they have a name? haha ) and they were incredible! I wish I would have remembered the name of the stand/business I purchase them from. My friend and i gathered our food and we sat down near the Hudson River which was pleasant and relaxing. Only comment would be that it can get pricy real quick if you buy a few things from multiple stands -which is very easy to do with so many diverse cuisines . However that said, it is a great way to try a bunch of the local restaurants without having to visit each store. Be prepared for crowds\n\n*Note this visit was prior to quarantine', ""I love food halls and this was no exception.\n\nWe shared between a bunch of people. We tried: pizza cupcakes from Pizza Cupcake, coxhina from Patiaco Brazuca, arepas from Vayalo Cocina, baos from Mao's Bao, ice cream with merengue from Bona Bona, donuts from Dough.\n\nWe love almost everything. The pizza cupcakes were surprisingly doughy and delicious. The arepas had great fillings and I loved the coxhina. Most places let us get a variety of flavors/fillings which I loved.\n\nThe merengue on top of ice cream was everyone's favorite. I never want ice cream any other way now.\n\nThe only thing I tried that I didn't like was the donuts from Dough. They looked really good and had unique flavor options, but the base donut just tasted like dry bread.\n\nThey are currently inside for the winter. It was a good venue, but I would love to go to one of their outdoor markets when it's nice outside.\n\nI'm so happy we came here on our trip and we'll probably be back again on our next trip."", 'This was on my list to do while in town, so we decided to come by on Saturday and check out the flea market and get some eats.  \n\nJust Google Map how to get here, in the Fall/Winter, it\'s indoors, took a good minute to figure out how to get into the building but we managed. It\'s on the 8th floor. No entry fee or hand stamps. I wore a hipster beanie to blend in.\n\nPretty average to medium sized space when you get up there. We hit up the food spots first and tried some foods from a few different vendors. I would say there were about 12 or so food vendors. I cant remember all the names of the places we hit up but we got some tacos which were pretty delicious, got a Taiwan pork bun/bao which was pretty darn good, some Brazilian coxinha balls stuffed with stuff that were tasty, and this gimmicky ""pizza cupcake"" that was kind of lame and the staff there was a bit aloof. But most of it was fine and we were hungry. The vendors we went to had a cash option.\n\nThe flea market part was ok as well, we didn\'t see anything particular we wanted to buy so we just looked around and perused through all the stuff.  The prices weren\'t what you would think flea market prices, we didn\'t see too many deals or steals.\n\nI\'m thinking the warm months when it is outside, that\'s the time to come here and check out all the food and flea market vendors. We were only here for about an hour or so, then we took off elsewhere.\n\nIt was ok in my book, worth coming by to check out if you\'ve never been.']",,[],https://www.yelp.com/biz/williamsburg-smorgasburg-saturday-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

It was so delicious (though different than what you'd actually receive in Japan). It was like sweet pancake batter. The edges were crisp and the inside soft and delectable.\n\nBetween the red bean and custard fillings, the traditionalist in me wants to recommend the red bean.

I will certainly be back again next time I'm in area."", 'Stopped by to get some work done in the AM.\n\nPros:\n- Vegan options! I grabbed a vegan muffin here and it definitely hit the spot. Tea was also delicious!\n- Very friendly staff. Always refreshing\n- Plenty of seating. Free wifi too. Great spot to work.\n\nCons:\n- Nothing that I can think of\n\nOverall, I thought this place was great! Very conducive for productivity.', ""This is by far the best coffee shop I've been to in Downtown Brooklyn. Everything about this cute coffee is perfect. I'm thrilled to see Coffee Project NY in Brooklyn because I never had a chance to visit the East Village location.  I always wanted to check this place out but the East Village location is usually cramped with college students (like me). This place, in contrast, has so much more space and are not too busy!!\n\nFirst, I love how bright this place is. The decor is clean and modern. There is a long table, but not too wide, for those working people with laptops. The lower tables are perfect for those who want to hang out with friends or read books.\n\nThe Coffee Project is an expert in NYC coffee space, and it's evident as soon as I walked into the store. It offers a wide range of coffees and brewing method. The signature menu includes so many unique brews such as the Nitro Set and the deconstructed latte. Both looked so tempting but I wanted to get a croissant so I went with the less extraordinary drink. I had an almond latte - I know, so basic, but it's my go-to drink whenever I have to study. My almond latte always tasted so much richer than the regular milk coffee. It was so creamy and delicious!! The milk foam on top was so thick. The coffee overall was not watery.\n\nThe pastries selection were also very attractive. I love croissants and have a high expectation for this type of pastry. At this cafe, my addiction for croissant was satisfied. The Coffee Project NY sells sourdough croissants from Roberta's, including the classics like Pain Au Choclat, Almond Croissant, and Plain. But it also makes it own croissant sandwich, both savory (avo mash, cheese and ham, egg) and sweet (almond butter and banana, dark chocolate banana and honey) etc. Just thinking about those pastries makes me so happy already. I only had a chocolate croissant because I wanted to test out the croissant quality first. The croissant was very flaky but soft inside. However, it was not very buttery. Instead, I could feel a bitter aftertaste after each bite. I'd say that the croissant here tastes more like bread and less like a dessert. Which is completely fine since Coffee Project then stuffs a lot of food inside anyway. My croissant had a generous amount of dark and mildly sweet chocolate chunks. I've never had any chocolate croissant with that much chocolate inside. It was such an unexpected treat so me since I only wanted something light to study hehe.\n\nWill I return to this place? 100% yes. Next time I'd invite a friend with me so we can share their specialty drinks. I think that those drinks are more suitable to share with another friend because they double the serving portion. But you can have one just for yourselves, if you're a caffein-addict or you need that extra kick to concentrate on your work for a long time.""]",,[],https://www.yelp.com/biz/coffee-project-new-york-fort-greene-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

I don't live in the area and I haven't traveled to Bay Ridge in a long while since the quarantine so forgot how terrific Anthony's is.  Finally went to Anthony's yesterday via car service and I'm so happy I did!  I bought cooked chicken cutlets, pasta with broccoli and uncooked ground beef for a meatloaf I'm going to make.  First of all the chicken cutlets were nice and thin just the way I like them and the pasta was perfectly seasoned.  Both were very satisfying and delicious!  The ground beef looks to be very high quality.  I'm making my meatloaf tonight, so I'll know more later, but I'm confident it will be great.  The ladies taking the orders at the front are super friendly, professional and caring.  I can say the same for the owner, who I spoke to on the phone to ask their hours and what types of food they have.  Great family business and you can easily tell they take great pride in what they do.  Looks like I'll be taking more trips to Bay Ridge.  Highly recommend."", ""I'm writing this post to highlight the customer service at this deli. Originally I was supposed to host thanksgiving for my family. About a month before thanksgiving I went in and spoke directly with the owner Anthony . He was kind and very helpful. He was happy to talk with me and provide me with my unusual request to have a deconstructed turkey. Anthony not only reassured me I would have a quality turkey the way I requested but also walked around the store with me to help me pick out various meats and cheese for antipasto I was making . Unfortunately  plans had to change and I had to cancel my order . Anthony was not angry by my call very kind and great-full I cancelled within enough time. Although I did not buy anything this day , I will certainly return here for any future butcher/deli needs I have."", ""I came here for the first time and ordered Thanksgiving dinner by the pound for my family of 3 (the incredibly sweet owner, Anthony, warned me that the package would be way too big for us). The turkey, bread stuffing, rice stuffing, mash potatoes and gravy, and stuffed mushrooms were all phenomenal and exceeded all expectations. My daughter says it was the best Thanksgiving meal we've ever had. My husband, who normally complains about anything he doesn't cook himself, was absolutely silent as he cleaned off his plate. We forgot he was even there until he was done eating. Honestly, the worst part was that I didn't buy more stuffing. We could've probably downed 2 more pounds of that. All in all, it took us about 15 minutes to eat everything and a week and a half to stop talking about it."", ""I'd been taken here before, for a sandwich which was phenomenal.\n\nI went alone today with a list, and I've never been to a pork store alone before.

The steak is not like a Philly cheesesteak but instead about 1/4"" thick slices of actual steak.  Different, but really good, high quality sandwich.  Also picked up some bell& Evans chicken breasts for dinner.  All the meat looks very clean and fresh.  Definitely will be returning soon.', 'Delicious sandwiches! Fresh meat. Deli owner Anthony is also very welcoming and sweet', ""Always passed by and meant to come in but today I finally did.\nComing in the first impression is that its neat and super clean layout. Second impression as I walk around the store is how much homemade and high quality products they have. The meats looked so fresh and it seems that they have a high turnover rate of food. I purchased the Bay Ridge Special on a roll and it meant my expectations. The chicken wasn't dry and everything meshed well together.\nLastly the service- very helpful and informative. Walking in made me feel a bit nostalgic for the days when you felt like you walked into a family versus a store and this place def had that neighborhood family vibe.\nWould recommend on service and quality."", ""Not a nice place,employee was very nasty when you pay $10.00 for a cold cut sandwich you schould get what you want as a customer I was thrown out the store by the the employee making my sandwich.

They use quality beef and tastes like it too. They don't use dressings/sauces for them unless you ask to and for the steak sandwich, I dont think you need them. I imagine that most sandwich spots rely on sauces because inherently, they aren't that good. One thing I hate about eating heroes or any sandwiches is that when you bite it, the entire damn innards of the sandwich shifts back, down, left, right, whatever and then just creates a total mess.

L'imprimerie makes easily the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. They're big, tasty, and the perfect amount of sweet without being overwhelmingly so. The croissants are phenomenal, maybe the best in the city.

Lackluster for $15 in Bushwick/Ridgewood. Bread was so hard. Way too many pickles. Ham and cheese were too subtle tasting for hard bread and sour pickles. Should be saltier and/or fattier. I'll come back for pastries. Weird to fail such an easy sandwich. Like Brie and prosciutto bro.\n\nBaguettes shouldn't be made that mini and skinny also. That's why bread was so hard."", ""This was a perfectly fine almond croissant. It could be because I got there fairly late in the evening that it just wasn't as soft or buttery as I'd prefer.

The trek to Brooklyn was worth it.', ""Rolled up to La Bicyclette too late on Saturday and had to find another bakery nearby to buy my bread when L'Imprimerie, 15 min away, was recommended. Lines were equally as long since only one person is allowed to enter the bakery at a time.

The chocolate-pear croissant was incredible, and even though I'm not a huge fan of baked fruit, the pears were a perfect, mellow complement to the slightly bitter chocolate. The pastries were deliciously flaky and buttery-- well worth the trek to Bushwick.\n\nThe miche has a lovely, dark crust with an open crumb and hearty, malty taste. I've been eating it as toast, as a tartine, as a grilled cheese sandwich-- this miche will do it all and then some.

We just grabbed a quick bite and shared the oysters and burger with a few drinks. Since it was our first time we weren't sure if we were going to like the food but ended up liking our meal very much.\n\nThe burger was cooked perfectly (med rare as we requested) packed with bombing flavors. Loved the lightly toasted bun. There's so much detail with the layered flavors in this dish. The potatoes were also cooked perfectly and everything was served warm!!! You can tell they pride themselves on their menu and service. I hate going to places and getting cold food. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I was kind of bummed when I saw on the menu that it wasn't fries but quickly changed my mind after eating the potatoes. It was warm, crispy on the outside while soft and tender in the inside, perfect pairing with the sauce it comes with.\n\nWe also got the special oysters. So so happy we got that!

The sheer level of craft beers warms my heart-- very reminiscent of my trip to Kopenhagen.\n\nI decided after some help on the ungespundet: a traditional German kellerbier. Classic, smooth, easy drinking.\n\nFor food, I had the sourdough bread with butter. I break out on eating butter, but I sacrificed that tonight. And I am quite content with this sacrifice. Warm bread and thick bread will do wonders for your heart. I followed this up with the chicken sandwich. People: Tom's hot sauce with this perfectly cooked chicken is ridiculous. I haven't been eating much lately so I was worried that I wouldn't finish it. I lied to myself thoroughly. I almost licked the plate. Only caveat making this a 4.5: I asked for no pickles-- there was an abundance of them.\n\nTo finish off, I asked for a recommendation and was given a nice hoppy beer: the Smashed Habro- a single malt IPA. Not all IPAs sit with me too well, but this one did. I was tempted to get another and remembered I had somewhere to be.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable experience. I'll be back for more beer and I'll be sure to bring friends with me.\n\nAs always, happy eating and drinking.

We ordered the sourdough starter and the sweet potato and chorizo fritters. The sourdough bread was mostly burned, but the butter spread that they give you is so amazing that we were willing to look past it. The fritters were 90% sweet potato and 10% chorizo. A little bland, but the sauce that they give you helps with some more flavor.\n\nThe beer is served in wine glasses that have these cute minimalist tree drawings on the outside. They kind of have an Old World vibe to them. I tried the Stands To Reason first which was good but I didn't care too much for the smokey flavor. The Scurry was much better!

With this pandemic going on what worries people the most is how sanitary the environment from which they\'re ordering their food from is: When I walked in the place was sparkling. It was so organized, there was a divided line for pick-up orders and takeout orders. Everyone was within distance from each other and the whole staff was taking their precautions very seriously. Things like that make you feel comfortable and put you at ease knowing that where you\'re getting your food from is a very clean place.\n\nIn regard to the food, you know you\'re at an awesome pizzeria when you constantly hear the workers shoutout ""fresh pizza coming out in two minutes"" ""fresh chicken rolls coming out now"" fresh fresh FRESH. Such an easy quick pick-up and go, whats the point of reheating when it\'s already steaming hot? I definitely ordered too much than I can handle but it\'s hard not too when you see these savory slices in front of you. Not only did I order a slice but some dinner meals too. Everything tasted amazing.\n\nEvery single person on the staff is incredible. They\'re so quick, hard working, and most importantly both respectful & kind. Tony\'s definitely gives you that ""at home"" vibe because they make you feel comfortable and welcomed. That\'s the first thing I felt when I walked in through those doors. They\'re very community oriented and work hard on trying to gather everyone together for community events. And that to me is a very important skill to have, to want to not only be just another pizzeria but a pizzeria that can reach out and change the lives of many--no matter what age, race, sexual orientation, background etc.. Just to make everyone in Brooklyn, one big happy family. They\'re currently making ""pizza prep kits"" where they fill up a large pizza box with all the materials you need to make your own pizza. It\'s such a great idea, especially during these times. Kids aren\'t in school and I\'m not a mom, but I know what it\'s like to have a child drive you absolutely insane (haha). These pizza kits are amazing and will give a kid something to do and also something to learn.\n\nFRIENDLY ADVICE: Since they\'re delivery and takeout only due to COVID-19 try to be more understanding if your delivery did happen to take longer than expected. There are people who chose to work through this pandemic and chose to help serve others. Be patient and kind.\n\nDo I recommend Tony\'s??

Its really great food and speedy delivery.', 'We had a party of 20 (split tables because of Covid ) and our server Anthony was amazing! Fast and amazing service very accommodating to all requests. Will recommend and come here again', ""As the highest rated Patsy's in NYC, I think it's easy to get caught up in the hype especially since the Brooklyn standard for pies is so high. After many meals and outings here, I can attest to the tastiness of the pizza and think it's an ideal option for a post Barclay's event meal. Out of all the Patsy's locations, I feel confident that this is the best one.\n\nLike any good pizza parlor, the old school feel is already a big thumbs up. The walls are adorned with random portraits / photos of sports figures, vintage celebrities, and big screen TVs. They also have a patio out back complete with ceiling fans and tables for all group sizes. The smell of the coal oven baking away in the kitchen is a great way to get folks fired up. (#1)\n\nThe pizzas are lovely. The thin crust and sauce go a long way in keeping the pies consistent. While the margherita tends to get a lot of love for its simplicity and presentation, I think the caprese (fresh mozz, tomato, basil) is a nice curveball since it has no sauce. I tend to go for the meaty macellaio (pepperoni, sausage, meatballs) but think the alla vodka with anchovies is easily their most underrated pie. When in doubt, an original pepperoni is always an excellent choice.\n\nOther foods I enjoy eating here include their chicken parm, the scogolio aka squid ink pasta with seafood, their octopus appetizer, and their non-rummy house made tiramisu. Some of the other forgettable items have been the calamari, linguine alla vongole, and their baked clams. Given how often people order the latter, I feel like I have to give it another shot.\n\nThe one thing that has kept me from putting them in 5 star range has been the slow service. The staff is uber friendly and the delivery is pretty fast even. However drink orders have been slower than food at times and my group and I have been puzzled at how long it takes for them to get stuff out previously. We try not to focus too much on it since most things are good and the attitudes never reflect any potential issues.\n\nOne of these days, I plan on enjoying a good warm pie in the cold weather, hopefully near one of the heaters on their outside patio. Pandemic pizza is totally a thing.\n\n__________\n(#1) I'm punny, not funny."", ""Cool Hand Lu says:  Pizza is my weakness and it's just not fair...\n\nMet up with a friend to wrap up August and a beautiful Sunday to indulge in some cheesy goodness...  The outside section was spacious enough to be seated and socially distant from the other patrons.  I was also glad to see that the waiter had on both a mask and gloves.\n\nWe first ordered a simple Margherita pizza first.  It took no time at all for the pizza to get to us.  I imagine mostly because of this new normal, but still a pleasure when it was unexpected.  It was a great pie and didn't last too long at all.  The second pie was the vodka pie with mushrooms, anchovies and fresh garlic.  Definitely a salt bomb!  Was an excellent pie though...  I paired my slices with a Peroni and my friend had a Chianti...(I think...).  Both were thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nService was great throughout the entire meal and never felt like we were being ignored or forgotten.  My friend unfortunately dropped her leftovers and was able to get a mini pie to make up for it.  Definitely appreciate the accommodation for that.  \n\nAll in all, I definitely felt like a glutton when done, but it was worth it.  lol.  If in the area definitely check it out."", ""Wanted thin Margherita Pizza and this place hit the spot! We ordered the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread, Margherita Pizza, pepperoni/sausage Pizza and linguine with clam sauce. Mozzarella sticks were good, had a lot of cheese. The garlic bread was yummy but if you don't like garlic then it's not for you. It had a lot of garlic in it. Both of the pizza was delicious. It was thin and crispy with perfect amount of sauce and cheese. The only dish that was bleh is the linguine with clam sauce. The linguine was hard and not much sauce. It was not flavorful at all. The back patio was nice and didn't have a lot of people with enough space between the tables. All the workers wore a mask. Wish they had more paper tissue for us to use instead of table cloth to wipe our mouths. Overall the experience was good and would visit them again for the pizzas!"", ""Such a tough time deciding whether to give Patsy's 4 or 5 stars. If 4.5 was allowed, that would be my pick.\n\nWe started by sharing the Caesar salad and the blackened octopus appetizer. The salad was crisp and fresh. The octopus was amazing! Two thick pieces of perfectly cooked octopus.  There was way more than I expected -- great value (which isn't something I've said often on our NYC trip).\n\nThen my daughters and I shared the vodka sauce pink pizza and my husband had the chicken Parmesan sandwich/sub. The pizza was unique and very tasty. The chicken sandwich was good but not a must have.\n\nThe ambiance was really cool -- felt like eating outside because of the light and screened effect, but without the chill of winter.\n\nHighly worth considering if you're in the area."", ""Intended on making dinner at home, but got lazy and decided to try Patsy's out. I know what I'm about to say may considered slightly crazy, but I am not a fan of pizza. Patsy's might make you change your mind.

It was delicious and definitely recommend."", ""OMG, Patsy's Pizzeria was simply magnificent. Menu items are fantastic and the team is very courteous.

We were seated on the side street and enjoyed our dinner. If you go, order the Pretzel. It is large and delicious.  We ordered PEI Mussels and the Wiener Schnitzel as our mains. The Mussels were prepared in a Riesling sauce, and they were very tasty. The Schnitzel was very tender, and the accompanying potato/cucumber salad's were very good.

Even more impressive for the questions about hot or cold water and other amenities we might need.

All of the wonderful descriptions also patiently weitten in chalk inspired our our eager and excited ordering. While I remember not the dishes in detail, I clearly remember how they made me feel.

I have only ever eaten at the restaurant portion as its usually more crowded near the bar area. Regardless of where you sit though you can expect the atmosphere to be dark and rustic. It almost feels like your in some 50 year old Austrians garage with the old brick walls and old road sign paraphernalia on the walls. It is unique and I like the homeyness of it.\n\nAnother thing that makes Werkstatt stand out is the fantastic sausage. They have a sizable selection of sausage dishes to choice from and since this is ""Austrian"" food the sausages include both bratwurst, kielbasa and other regional varieties between Germany and Eastern Europe. I almost always get the sausages when I come to Werkstatt... the more sauerkraut the better! Though they more not appear big in pictures these dishes I would say really do fill you up.\n\nBesides the sausage other items on their menu are quite delicious as well. Since this place is a bit of a walk for me I like to get one of their strudels to finish my meal. They are not overly sweet but satisfying. If I am really hungry I will throw in one of their large pretzels for a appetizer. Don\'t do this unless you know your stomach will fit it... this combined with everything else will make you burst.\n\nWerkstatt is one of my favorite places to go to. It adds additional color to the coney island ave restaurant scene and the food is just delicious.', ""This is our go-to-neighborhood place. The restaurant is run so well and has a great extensive menu unlike new trendy restaurants. The wait staff are so professional and efficient. There are always new and exciting specials on the board.

They were coated in a sweet but savory spice.\nShrimp: I loved that they peeled the shrimp for us completely, even the tail! Points for paying attention to the details! The sauce this came with was delicious!\nVeggies: my husband hates vegetables, but he was definitely fighting with me for more! The flavor was amazing.\nFried rice: the rice was al dente, like how fried rice should be. The flavor was out of this world! I tasted either cumin or fennel. This definitely hit the spot for me.\nPork ribs: so tender! Coated with just the right amount of marinade.\nPork belly: what can I say? I love my pork bellys, and this one was of course awesome.\nChicken wings! The best ever! Personally i would pick these chicken wings over pelicana, mad for chicken or olive chicken ANY DAY!

Hours are 5:30-10 PM (a bit on the limited side for the area), but come when it's open and you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt's extremely small on the inside, with limited table seating and some counter space. I dined an early dinner here with my boyfriend, and we sat at the counter. The entire time we chatted with the owner, who mentioned the place was in its soft-opening at the time (July 2019), but they were excited to finally have it up and running.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n- Chili-Glazed Hot Dog ($4): my favorite (and better than the kimchi hot dogs at Snacky a few blocks down), this dog comes fully garnished with herbs and a topping of chopped peanuts. Good eats.\n- Chili-Garlic Wings (order by the piece for $1): hot and directly out of the frier and smothered in a great sauce.\n- House Combo ($15): a make-your-own bowl, we got ours with Fork-Roast Pork Belly (slow-cooked, fatty goodness), blistered chili long-beans, and a base of wok-tossed noodz.\n\nWe topped these dishes with their sweet & spicy, homemade golden pepper sauce. What a meal."", ""Yum! Came here hungry after a work out class and was so glad to find it.

The food is filling and banging with flavor. I love that with the combo you have a slew of choices in three categories. I was excited to try anything as everything seemed good.\n\nI go the ribs with pork fried rice and string beans/bacon (and also the hibiscus tea). It was delicious. The beans were a bit salty but I prefer that to when they come bland.

I'm happy to report that the reheated version was just as delicious and satisfying.\n\nThe hibiscus tea was lovely. They don't have booze (yet?).

Can't even describe it - don't ever leave a meal here without finishing with this.\n\nTL;DR\n- Delicious Asian inspired comfort food that's guaranteed to hit the spot at very reasonable prices"", 'Wish I could give this place 5 stars but I cannot. Got the ribs and pork fried rice. Both were EXTREMELY salty. Food portion was decent but $17 for mid-scale chinese is a bit much.

I always seem to get lucky and buy the batch that's fresh out of the oven. Their khacapuri is warm, fluffy, and cheesy goodness. You can buy the bread by the slice or a whole pie which they can slice it into as many pieces you want. I believe it's around $3 for a slice and $8 for the pie, but check the menu. On my first visit, the staff was welcoming and offered suggestions, even showed me what each item looked like since I didn't know where to start. The second tiem around, I came for more Khacapuri and also left with beef and potato kubdari (flatbread pie). The kubdari was about the length of half of a hero bread and were savory. Total was about $28 for a cheese bread pie and four kubdari breads.\n\nI left without purchasing anything on my third visit because of poor service. I waited for more than 10 minutes, was visibly the next person in line, but they let a couple who entered the store cut me. Lady at the register didn't say a word. Now, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that they honestly didn't see me (being short, I do sometimes go easily unnoticed LOL) because it does happen, so not a deal breaker.\n\nI was lured back here by my cheese bread craving and on visit four bought two khacapuri's and beef kubdaris.

Other great non-coffee beverages, which I still need to try, include iced matcha (16 oz $5, with no milk-- good if you're vegan), matcha hot chocolate (12oz $6), tea, hot chocolate, and other seasonal beverages.  \n\nWhile other nearby coffee shops (IE: Black Star, True North, Black Brick, Gimme Coffee, The West, etc) have run out of decent pastries by 3pm on weekends, Charter still has a sizeable array of pastries.

I gave them 4 stars, and I have to admit that I was wrong.\n\nI've gone back and had pizza from some of the best NYC pizza spots since then, but I just couldn't stop thinking about Lucali. I felt compelled to go and get this pizza again. I went a few weeks ago and they have all their toppings back now (there was a very limited menu during the Covid peak). I went a little crazy and a got it with pepperoni, mushrooms and garlic. It was SO GOOD! Love the mushrooms, they use the big portabellas that taste delicious - a lot of pizza places have almost tasteless mushrooms, so this was a pleasant surprise. The pizza does get kind expensive with the toppings, so go with pepperoni if you don't want to empty your wallet.\n\nThis is the BEST pizza there is. Every single thing is perfect - the bread, the cheeses, the tomato sauce, the pepperoni. I can't believe I get to have this pizza whenever I want. I'm not worthy!"", 'Alright, so Lucali has been on my list for a while. I knew everything there was to know about Lucali without ever having been there. The Barstool 9.3 rating (one bite, everyone knows the rules..), Mark Iacono\'s (the owner) features on Munchies/Vice, the Pizza episode on Ugly delicious. I tried going once in 2018 on a weekday evening and was told there\'s a 2.5 hour wait, which is ridiculous. I know Mark Iacono\'s idea was that anyone can walk in and get a pizza without making reservations in advance - but when you\'ve gotten to the point that there\'s a daily 2.5 hour to even walk in, I think it\'s time to move to reservations!\nAnyway, one of the only positives of COVID is that now you can just get Lucali to go without having to wait that long to get in. I called them and placed an order, and it was ready in 30 minutes, just a few minutes after I reached. The pizza is great. There\'s multiple types of cheeses on there, so you get something different with each bite. The bread is really fresh and light, and I\'m usually not a big fan of crusts but I had the whole thing here. The pizza is huge, bigger than a Large from most places I think, but it\'s surprisingly light. I had more than half the pie and felt satisfied, and it didn\'t get to the point of regret where you think to yourself, ""What have I done"" / ""Why did I do that"".\nI think this is the best round pepperoni pie I\'ve had. Prince Street\'s square pepperoni slice might be #1. And personally, I prefer pizzas with more toppings, but if we\'re talking a no-frills pizza done right, this is up there. I give it a 8.9/10 to level off some of the hype, but I\'d definitely have this again and would recommend it to everyone, especially if they don\'t have to wait 2-3 hours to try it. I\'m going and getting more while they are still doing to-go orders, and maybe someday I will get to dine in.', ""After living in Brooklyn for almost 1.5 years so glad finally tried the pizza\nThey only have 2 dishes on their menu and it's cash only + BYOB.

This is a solid, good pizza.\n\nMy only gripe is it's a bit pricey. $27 for a pie? I could finish this pizza too quickly"", ""9.3/10\n\nCalzone: AMAZING; cheese is just right, not too heavy, not too light; perfect amount of crisp; no wetness you would commonly find in other calzones; YOU GOTTA ask for the garlic & hot pepper sauce, use it as a dip or pour on top, it makes the calzone much better than it already is; high quality cheese\n\nCheese pie: not as great as most say it is; top-notch ingredients in terms of quality (cheese, dough, sauce, fresh basil); basil does not go well with the pizza, adds a nice flavor, but I would take it off before biting into the actual pizza; too floppy for my liking, cheese falls off very easily, leaves you with about a bite with cheese per slice; dough is SPECTACULAR, don't think I've had better; decently crisp, but definitely not crisp enough; overall, slightly underwhelming because it seems the pizza doesn't add up the sum of its parts, albeit VERY GOOD parts, perhaps because it is a bit sloppy; also, could definitely use some quality control on the garlic, both my friend and I ended up biting into an entire clove of garlic each (8.7/10)"", ""Before the review I would like to state a couple of disclaimers :\n1. We ordered the pizza  Togo and were 10 minutes late picking it up.\n\n2. It took us close to 30 min to get home.\n\nNow for the review:\n\nI will admit I bought into the hype.  Checking various top 10 pizza lists online, this place always came in the top 3 if not the best.\n\nPros :  The pizza tastes good ( not amazing, or life changing or even world shattering)\n\nCons : The pizza doesn't travel well.  by the time we got home the crust was very soggy.\nBeing a New Yorker for over 40 years ....I tasted a lot of pizza.  This makes it in the top 10.\n\nBest pizza ( not even close )\nBest hype and marketing- 5 stars\n\nThen there is the cost.  Two pies, one regular and one with pepperoni, ran over $60.  That's one expensive pizza.\n\nOverall, it's a solid 3 star neighborhood pizza place.  I wouldn't go out of my way.   Was it worth, trying it once sure.   I will try anything once, will not be back anytime soon."", ""Ooooo you would've had 5 stars from me if only your hostess wasn't equipped with such a cold rude demeanor! I took advantage of coming here when they just opened their outdoor seating during COVID so the wait was only half an hour as opposed compared to its usual two hour wait. It is BYOB, so we just walked to a nearby liquor store to get a bottle of wine during the meantime.\n\nYou gotta add shallots, mushroom and pepperoni to your pie!! We did a pie, half of it as their classic Margherita and the other half with that combo... and that combo seriously slaps!! Next time will add garlic since everyone praises the garlic addition too. The ingredients are so fresh and the dough is super soft and fluffy yet a little crispy on the bottom. Even with all the toppings, for this style pizza it wasn't soggy at all or had too much of a crazy flop like some popular places I've tried. I could see how he built such a name for himself worldwide just from his pizza!"", ""Such a disappointment. I live in Manhattan and was so excited to try this place out. I drove in, looked for parking and waited for 30 mins for my pizza to be ready. I am one of those people that will wait hours on line if I have to get the best slice of pizza etc, but I will not tolerate bad service.\n\nI was trying to take a photo (for this review) from outside the window while I waited for my pizza and was spoken to extremely rude by the hostess. The hostess didn't like that I was taking a photo so she made a very nasty comment which I will leave out. I said to her it's not a big deal and I'm only taking a photo of the guys making the pizza for my review. She had such a nasty attitude and I'm not here for that.\n\nThis in NYC where we have hundreds of amazing pizzerias in every borough. In this pandemic when restaurants are closing down, places like this one don't show appreciation to the customers who are still coming to support their business. It's a shame and I won't be coming back again.\n\nAlso, $28 for a regular pizza pie is expensive AND you have to deal with bad customer service. Not worth it in my opinion."", ""Disclaimer: This review is about my experience back in the winter.. so way prior to Covid-19-\n\nFAVORITE.PIZZA.IN.ALL.OF.NY!!!\nNot even exaggerating.

My friend ordered the pork noodles and pork belly bao (two orders. They were so good he needed a round two). Everything was cooked to perfection, insanely flavorful, and just the right amount of food. When I asked about the shishitos, the owner came out herself and chatted with us and was so lovely. She ended up gifting us the most insane yuzuu pie, very key lime-esque with extra zing, and the perfect sweet salty graham cracker crust.\n\nI feel like Williamsburg is lacking restaurants like this.

I've lived here for over 3 years and can say that, with the ever-changing trends, millennials who love pan-Asian food and minimal decor (and food platings), will eat this place up and add fervently to their Insta feeds.\n\nThe restaurant has a calming vibe, perfect for a date or dinner with friends. I do wish the seating upstairs that features small stools and mini tables were not seats for meals, but rather for drinks. My party of 3 was seated in those and then we asked to be moved to a nearby booth, as no one was currently seated there. Service overall is hit or miss, as the waitstaff must climb up and down the stairs.\n\nNot knocking the food, though. Everything I had here was made to perfection and then some. Be aware, however, that portions are small, so expect to share. I liked these:\n- Onion roti with cashew curry ($7): I'm guessing they are going for minimal Malaysian roti canai here, and I liked it\n- Ramen ($16): good as a dish if you're dining solo\n- Cod in coconut lime broth ($17): my favorite of all and presented beautifully\n\nCome here to impress your party and bask in the dim lighting."", ""BEST NEW PLACE IN AREA.

Not only in taste but presentation and creativity.  \n\nI went there expecting Asian food with a twist but the food was more like contemporary American with an Asian touch.  (I wouldn\'t really think to compare this to ""authentic Chinese food"".  That\'s just apples vs. oranges.  Just because David Chang doesn\'t make the same food at Momofuku as you\'d find in Asia in no way detracts from the quality of his food.  Using as an example because the food reminded me of it.)\n\nInterior looks like a cafe almost, very comfortable and I would say low key given the good food.  There\'s also tables out on a beautiful terrace.\n\nMy favorite dish was the salted cod over rice which was almost like poke and very well balanced in flavors and textures.  Second favorite was the fried chicken sandwich which was way above expectation as someone who usually hates chicken.  The asparagus salad and Brussel sprouts were both light and complemented the other dishes well.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit.', ""Moving to Brooklyn to be closer to our restaurant doesn't sound like a bad idea to us, Sallie!

I've never seen a filled donut with that much filling in my life....in a good way. You can tell they don't skimp on the quality of ingredients the least bit.

The honey glazed yeast donut was everything you'd expect from a plain glazed donut. Light, airy, and covered in a thin sweet layer of glaze. The apple turnover donut was a beast. Its double the size of any of their donuts and its slathered with a thick layer of super sweet icing. Definitely don't do what I did and eat two donuts as you'll probably wind up regretting the decision you just made and gain about 5 pounds.\n\nThe donuts were great.

I ended up getting 11 donuts to try. Oops.\n\nSamosa: Wasn't crazy about this one. I was really excited to try it but it had a strange, unexplainable flavor to me.\n\nRaspberry filled: Yum!! They really don't skimp out on the fillings here.\n\nBavarian: Bavarian is one of my most favorite classic donut flavors!! Again, they don't skimp out on the filling here. Yum.\n\nNutella: Maybe because I haven't had Nutella in so long but this is definitely one of my faves.\n\nRainbow & Pistachio: I'm not a cake donut kind of gal. Honestly they were too dense and quite dry so I wasn't a fan at all.\n\nMaple bacon: I don't think I've ever had a real maple bacon donut prior to this but this was just ok.\n\nCannoli: HUGE. Soooooo much filling. Perhaps too much. Flavor was good though. I could only handle a couple of bites.\n\nRed Velvet Cream Crumb: I actually enjoyed this one! It was also very huge and kind of intimidating but surprisingly it wasn't as sweet as the other donuts which I like.\n\nBoston Cream: This was too sweet for me but that also could be because this was one of the last ones I tried and I was already sugared out. It would've been nice if the chocolate part was less sweet to balance the sweet cream filling.\n\nCroissant donut (Dossant): This was also just okay. The croissant was kind of soggy because of the filling but the flavor was still good.\n\nOverall, this place has good value for donuts. I find that their classic flavors are better than the others. I suggest getting only a few at a time because they can get a little too sweet! Don't be a glutton like me!"", ""I love donuts. So I really wanted this shop to work out.

The glazed old fashion is not as dense as Peter Dan, but it has a good cakey consistency. It was also not too sweet in my opinion. The salted caramel donut is a yeast donut, which was tasty, but a bit too sweet because of the salted caramel glaze on top.

Our waiter, Gennaro, was amazing and when we asked for food recommendations he did not steer us in the wrong direction. Every course (appetizer, entree, dessert) was delicious. I'd highly recommend the Italian Egg Roll and Tagliatelle al Cognac. Our cocktails were refreshing in the summer heat. It was our first time dining at Baci Ristorante and we'll definitely be back!!"", ""My wife and I always walk through this area and the food always looked great. We were intrigued by their new menu we were warmly assisted by the hostess. As we sat, we begin to look through the menu and order the NY Strip with carrots and broccoli, sweet and sour glazed pork chops and truffle fries. Every bite of the NY Strip was tasteful and paired perfectly with the red wine reduction. The assortment of carrots were flavorful alongside the NY strip.\n\nFollowing the dinner, we moved to our favorite dessert, the Nutella Tortino. Every single bite was creamy with flavors from the white chocolate, dark chocolate, Nutella and vanilla ice cream.\n\nOverall, this was the best way to spend a 73 degree weather day and we'll definitely be back! Thank you again to Ankley and the wonderful hostess for her warm welcome!"", ""Our most Favorite place in Bay Ridge\nFrom Service to Food to Decor\nEverything's a 10!!"", 'My Fav !!!\nWent yesterday! Place is sooo cute for date night\nAmazing Service , Fresh Yummy food !\nYummy Lobster Cocktail,  Burrata & Oysters !\nWill be back soon!', ""Came for a birthday celebration. Prior to our arrival, the restaurant spoke to me twice with regards to how they can accommodate our party during the pandemic. They seated our party in the party room. Great setup as we were isolated from the other indoor dining patrons.\n\nThe staff were friendly and attentive. The food was delicious from start to end. The Octopus Baci was delicious! Pear salad and lobster bisque were yummy as well. We had the Porterhouse for 2 at $150 but it was delicious! It came with spinach, fries, mac and cheese and fried onions! It can easily feed 3 ppl. We also ordered the sesame crusted yellow fin tuna, black cod, black linguini pescatore, shrimp arrabbiata and a few others. Every dish we had was tasty and delicious. You can't go wrong.\n\nDefinitely a gem in Bay Ridge. Highly recommend this place."", ""Where is the 6th star when you need it?! The food is like no other. Wish I could have ordered a little bit of everything off the menu. The appetizer special of shrimp wrapped in bacon over warm corn was one of the greatest dishes I've ever tried. I was given a choice of fried or baked calamari-- went with the baked for the first time and I was left speechless! The marinara sauce has just the right spicy kick to it. The octopus is served with the perfect sides that make the dish that much better.\nThe banana bread pudding blew me out of the water. It tasted fresh, homemade, and left me with a big smile on my face. Creme brulee is also a must!!\n\nThe service is unbeatable. I had an unforgettable experience at this gorgeous restaurant. Everything is clean and crisp. No wonder it is such a hot spot. Looking forward to my next experience with the friendly staff and delicious food. So many more dishes I am dying to try!"", 'Good ambiance, good service , overall really good Italian food .\nThey use organic chicken only which I love !!', ""Came with a party of 8. Food was beyond delicious. I strongly recommend the Italian eggroll. Yum ! Oysters were amazing. Burrata mozzarella, crab cakes, rock shrimp was so on point. Those were all sharing apps. I had the fettuccine like pasta with lobster and crab meat as a main and it was amazing. Our server, she was great. Glass was never empty and so personable.

The cakes are always as expected in quality and taste.\n\nAside from the cake, there could be some improvements on the service. For one, pre-order pick ups should be a separate line to walk ins. Honestly, being on the same line as walk ins gets frustrating since customers have no idea what they want yet. The only time they ever considered 2 lines are during major holidays. The other thing I want to point out is when I went to pick up a cake Thanksgiving eve, the person who assisted at the pick up counter did not have a mask on. However, everyone else did. He probably felt safe since he was in an environment where everyone else was covered up but, I definitely felt uneasy with him handling my cake without a mask on.

Very rich in flavor and thickness, but not overly sweet.\n\nI appreciated everything about this place.

The salted caramel cheesecake was a little too dense for my liking but the cheesecake itself was a great balance of sweet and tangy. Didn't get much of the salted caramel flavor but it was overall a good tasting piece of cheesecake. The Nutella Delight cake was not as rich as I expected it to be based on all the other reviews I had read. The chocolate sponge is light and airy, the Nutella mousse is tasty but I wish the buttercream frosting was more chocolatey.\nOverall, good desserts but nothing really stood out about either one that I tried. Will check out the other offerings to see how they fare."", ""This bakery is a dessert lover's dream! It has so many pastries lined up and glistening on display that it makes it so hard to get just one item. I came by to pick up a cake for my friend's birthday and someone helped me right away. I hadn't put in an order online, but was happy that they had the cake I wanted available on the spot.\n\nI ordered an 8 inch carrot cake and it came out to be $41, which I thought was very reasonable. The only downside was that you do have to pay for candles and even the cutting knife. They had some issues with their credit card machine that day which made the checkout process kind of long, but they apologized for the wait. My friends and I enjoyed the carrot cake! It was slightly too sweet for my taste, but still enjoyable. The layers of the cake were thick and very worth the price. I would recommend stopping by to satisfy your sweet tooth! The staff was very friendly and the items are fairly priced and worth the value. I believe they have outdoor seating in the back if you wanted to dine in as well."", ""Mia's is my hidden gem in downtown Brooklyn. The enormous selection of desserts that they have are amazing and so far, everything has been chef's kiss. My favorite would have to be the berry Napolean. I've tried the cheesecake (creamy, rich, decadent), carrot cake (yum!), and strawberry shortcake is light and delicious. Mia's is comparable to Martha's Country Bakery and that is a high remark because that's my favorite dessert place. The line is always out the door and they have a nice backyard seating area if you're interested! Highly recommend checking out Mia's to satisfy your sweet tooth, you won't be disappointed!"", ""Stumbled upon this gem before dinner nearby and it has been the best incidental find.

It was okay, but nothing I\'d go out my way for, unfortunately. For reference, I ordered the shrimp pad Thai, fried dumplings and Thai ice tea. Let\'s start with the pad Thai....\n\nVery TANGY. I\'ve actually never had pad Thai with that much tang, maybe it was the tamarind in the sauce? Not entirely sure but it was tangy and nutty and my personal palette didn\'t care for it. If those flavor profiles are your thing though, then you\'ll absolutely love this pad Thai because it has plenty of it! For that, I\'m docking 2 stars, as this was suppose to be the star of the show and it just wasn\'t. Not an authentic flavor profile in my opinion, but than again, maybe mine was a fluke? I don\'t know. On a much higher note..................\n\nThe fried dumplings with the sweet chili sauce was FIRE. Sooo good, but sooooo tiny. These are the tiniest dumplings I\'ve ever had but they were delicious, so I can look past that. We will just rename them ""tiny delicacies"". Okay. Rant over. Back to the flavor profile lol savory, well seasoned and nicely fried aka crisp. Loved everything about it! I\'ve been to many Thai restaurants, and the taste is definitely on par with authentic THAI dumplings, so definitely expect all those wonderful Thai spices and aromas to be present in these dumplings. YES!!\n\nThe Thai ice tea was great! The perfect ratio of tea to creamer. Loved it! Believe it or not, this is a big deal because I\'ve definitely been to Thai restaurants with bizarre tasting Thai tea and coffee. (One tasted fizzy, like soda. Yuck was an understatement). Good on them for making something so traditional, so delicious and sticking with what\'s NOT broke. It was a beautiful addition to a simple meal.\n\nOverall, I\'ll be back to give it another fair chance as the pad Thai was the one and only item that underwhelmed me. I will be back with an update soon, but you definitely can\'t go wrong with their dumplings and Thai teas! Wonderful.', 'I ordered on door dash a few days ago. The food was amazing.

This place is also deep - they have everything you're looking for and more (come here to grab dog food when the pet store is closed).

So I had to hustle at the last minute to get my sisters to come with me. And at that point it was suppertime. So here's my review making the best of non-brunch meal.\n\nDecor: SBF is dope. I love the indoor seating because it has these cute pillows and alcoves-very homey, aesthetically speaking. And the outdoor is really cute too; love the colors and the benches.\n\nService: Because it's been so long since I've written a review, I have effectively forgotten my lovely waiter's name. He was the best though: cued up a playlist for us, brought the music outside, made excellent suggestions and made us laugh. I'm glad to see that excellent service has not died.\n\nFood/Drinks: Let's start with drinks. I had just the one actually. But this is where the half star demotion comes in because the lime mildly overpowered it. Was it still decent, yes. Was it something to write home about, no. To start I had the honey ricotta and fruit bread. This thing right here: mildly sweet, beautiful texture. I had to stop myself from finishing it because I knew I had more food coming. T decided to help me with that by devouring a HEFTY portion of my bread and ricotta. I was mildly displeased. Moving on to the buttermilk chicken sandwich: yes. Crispy, fresh, and the foundry sauce was just the perfect complement. I can't remember if T had the Beyond or Foundry burger but she wasn't the biggest fan-- again nothing to write home to, but I'm not a big burger fan to begin with, so don't quote me. The SWEET POTATO FRIES!!! We all devoured every last piece. That's all to be said about that.\n\nI will definitely be coming back when Auntie Rona decides to stop being a nuisance or I may order takeout at work. I enjoyed myself very much.\nAs always, happy eating and drinking. MMG"", 'TL;DR: great outdoor seating with music and the burgers are amazing.\n\nMy fiancé and I came here after taking our puppy to the dog park. They have a nice set-up outside and I appreciated the ""flooring"" that they installed, so it didn\'t feel like you were really sitting on the street/sidewalk concrete.\n\nWe started with their chicken wings, which was just okay, and the only reason they didn\'t get 5 stars from me. I would skip this in the future.\n\nFor drinks, we got a Bloody Mary and a cold baileys and whiskey (i forgot the name of the drink). They were both really good. He Bloody Mary had a nice kick to it.\n\nI got the Chef\'s Burger while she got the Foundry Burger. Both were really good. Cooked to perfection. Very juicy. Flavorful. I really enjoyed it.\n\nWe got sweet potato and truffle fries as well. Both were crispy and fried just right and packed great flavor. Sort of strange to say that for fries but it was really good. Not bland at all.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back. Great food and drinks. Love the outdoor seating and the music too - definitely made it more lively.\n\nOh and it\'s dog friendly too! They immediately brought out a water bowl for our little pup.', ""My friend and I have had our eyes on South Brooklyn Foundry for a while. After passing by and seeing the nice outdoor dining setup, we decided to have brunch here.\n\nWe came in around 12:30pm on a Sunday and were seated immediately at an outdoor, tented table which was nice for a gloomier day. The tables were definitely spaced apart, and seating was also a fair distance from the busy sidewalk which we definitely appreciated.\n\nTo start our brunch, we each had a Kahlua and coffee drink with cinnamon and opted to skip the whipped cream. These were SO good. I was also happy to see a Yelp check-in offer for 50% off a cocktail, albeit towards the end of our meal, but our waiter redeemed this for us and the $6.00 was taken off of our bill. Not many places in the area offer Yelp discounts so I was happy they honored this.\n\nWe waiting about 20 minutes for our food (maybe indoor dining was busy?) but we didn't mind since we were enjoying our delicious coffee concoctions and talking about the universe. When our food did arrive, it was worth the wait. My friend got the Chopped Benedict Bowl and swapped the ham for bacon (a pro-move if I do say so myself) and I opted for the French Toast Sliders. We both cleaned our plates. This was was the most delicious meal we've had together in a while! And that means a lot coming from me, as someone who isn't crazy about brunch. This made me excited to try dinner (and dessert) here.\n\nI felt the outdoor dining experience was safe overall, but I do wish all of the staff wore masks properly from the beginning to the end of serving customers. We're all human so I know masks come down and get taken off sometimes, but that was one small thing that I noticed. That note aside, our servers were lovely and made us feel right at home.\n\nFYI - it's cash only during brunch!"", ""This is the best low-key brunch spot in Bay Ridge.  We had the buttermilk pancakes, breakfast burrito and Benedict bowl and each dish lived up to my expectations.

I NEVER EVER eat at 5pm, so understand the significance of this. I don't even know what to call a 5pm dining time.\n\nIndoor seating (within COVID parameters) is again a thing here, but we were feeling like eating outside on one of the remaining nice nights of the season. At 5pm, you'll have your pick of tables (indoors or out), even on a Saturday. A hostess greets you at the door, and if you're eating inside, you gotta do the QR code thang. All good.\n\nWe sat. We put our order in all easy peasy via QR code and everything came out quickly. I tore into that pizza like the savage I am when it comes to pizza.\n\nThere are those plexiglass dividers between tables out there, which would normally make me feel safe... until a gust of wind made it fall, hitting my head and a glass of water across our pizzas.\n\nLuckily one of the servers saw this and was super cool about making new ones for us. Look, I'm not even going to pretend that I didn't keep eating the slices that were unaffected by the spillage. This fucking pizza is THAT delicious. I've tried several of the vegan pies, but In Ricotta da Vegan is surely the most decadent, with its dollops of cashew ricotta and plant-based sausage. I'm an arugula fanatic so it's absolute rapture going on in my mouth with each bite.\n\nLook, I don't even want to hear it if you think this place is overrated. You're wrong."", ""100% lives up to the hype.\n\nPizza is life and Neapolitan-style is my absolute favorite. I typically have to order it without cheese because there is rarely a vegan cheese option but I still adore it because... that crust! Thank you, oh thank you thank you thank you, Paulie Gee for stepping it up a notch and offering an entire menu of vegan pizza options. I was almost giddy when I saw that I actually had choices here! And what a happy surprise to see they don't use Daiya (which is OK, but the texture isn't quite right and a lot of people seem to hate it), rather they use house made cashew ricotta and NUMU mozzarella. I was most intrigued by the latter and chose the Vegan Daniela Spinaci (minus the fresh garlic cuz I can't) and added on vegan sausage. I wish I could have ordered 2 pizzas but I had plans after dinner and figured I'd leave the leftovers behind. Give a vegan options and she goes wild.\n\nWhen it arrived, it was a sight to behold so despite wanting to dig in + devour, I snapped a pic because I knew I'd want to relive the memories. And then, then... uh, forgive me but a food fugue might have started and I'll say it: here is pizza perfection! Chewy Neapolitan-charred crust plus just the right amount of cheese (superb texture, ie not runny like Daiya) plus spinach and basil and little chunks of crispy vegan sausage...oh my fucking god, let's just say I saw the light. Food fugue state. While not a common occurrence for me, here it was a reality.\n\nDig the atmosphere: you enter through giant barn-like doors into a dark 'n cozy rustic cave reminiscent of a Sienna trattoria. But hey, I could have been served this pizza on a hard bench in a cold cafeteria with florescent lighting, that's how good it is. As you all know, Pauly stops by each table (briefly and it's not intrusive at all) to make sure you're good. It's genuine customer service, a rarity these days. Let's face it, he has restaurants now in several other cities (PLEASE COME TO NEW ORLEANS, PAULIE!!!!), so it's no secret he's made it. While the operation can probably run on its own, he's still there every night.\n\nFinally I'm just going to come out and say it: I used to think nothing would ever come close to my guy Kenny's Brick Oven Pizza which sadly closed around 5 years ago, but wow. I'll never go to another pizza place in Brooklyn again now that I've found Paulie Gee."", ""I've always been a fan of Paulie Gee's despite my mishaps with the Slice Shop. I've been meaning to take friends here because I think this is the best pizza I've ever had in New York, even better than Roberta's. I came with friends who think Roberta's is overrated so I was a bit nervous with what they have to say about my favorite pizza spot.\n\nWe ended up ordering 4 pies and 2 bottles of the malbec. In retrospect, I should have brought my own bottle and just paid the $25 corkage fee (not because their wine selection is bad but because I can get my bottles for cheap!)\n\nMy friends ended up loving the Dellboy and King Harry's Classic. I personally always order th Hellboy but since both of my friends don't like mixing sweet and savory, we ended up with the version without the hot honey sauce.\n\nI also liked the hometown brisket because of the pickled red onions. The pizzas are thin crust, and finished most of the pies. There were passersby who ended up ordering pizza upon seeing our pizza.\n\nPaulie Gees has always been full and it's difficult to get a seat from this place pre-covid. Now, they offer outdoor seating and 25% capacity for indoor seating. Protocols are in place. Glass partitions are placed between seats and sanitizers available. Good time to visit before 7pm on a weekday. I got there at 6:30 and was seated right away.\n\nBefore I forget, you can take your pupper with you when you dine outside!"", ""This review is for my visit to Paulie Gee's that occurred pre-COVID, so I can't comment on how things are right now; nevertheless, this restaurant is amazing! My friend and I ordered the In Ricotta Da Vegan and Chop't 'Til You Drop pizzas (both vegan), and both were ridiculously good. The flavors & textures of each pizza were astounding and they were cooked perfectly. Not only did I eat my entire pizza, I ate nearly half of my friends. I could not get enough. The reviews do not lie, these pizzas were some of the best that I have had in my entire life. This is the type of place that you regret visiting only because the food is so bomb that you crave it every single day. Furthermore, the food was made quickly and service was amazing. Definitely add this to your list of must visit restaurants in NYC. I wish there was a location on the west coast. I cannot wait to return!"", ""My friend had been telling me about this place for YEARS so I had to stop by when I was in Brooklyn again to get my NY vegan pizza fix!\n\nI ended up at the slice shop first and thought it was decent - I tried all four of their vegan options. Pretty standard vegan pizza, but love that they even have vegan options and are a good quick option.\n\nThen, while AT the slice shop, I saw that the real restaurant was a couple blocks away so I went right after. Soooo glad I did because I LOVED the vegan pizza there (aka here, Paulie Gee's) I got the In Ricotta Da Vegan. The dollops of cashew ricotta were AMAZING and I was a very happy camper.\n\nThey currently have limited indoor seating, so my friend and I sat at in a corner and were adequately distanced from the next table."", 'You must come try this establishment! The pizza is unreal. They serve you neapolitan style pizza. The vegan WOW out of this world! I arrived  before  my boyfriend and decided to order a pizza and some drinks. Wow amazing... I have a dairy allergy and it prevents me to eat dairy. To his disbelief he had no clue it was not just dairy free but vegan as well. He also has a dietary restriction - due to religious beliefs he can not eat pork.\n\nThe organic wines are great please do give them a try but ask for recommendations from the staff or Bartender.', ""A solid pizza, doing well with Covid measures, and seemingly a staple for those in the area.\n\nThe pizza wasn't too doughy and it was pretty cheesy. We got a cheese pie for $24 and it was delicious! Not as pipin' hot as we would have liked but good nonetheless. When I ordered a fountain drink, I asked for no ice. Then, just to confirm, I mentioned no ice again. When I got my drink there was ice in it. No harm in that, still enjoyed my meal and my time at Paulie Gee's, just something to note!\n\nThe outdoor seating was great!

I absolutely loved the way the sweetness & rich flavor of the honey complimented the pizza. There was a bit of a wait when we arrived, but it went by pretty fast.\n\nIf I were to come back, I would order the Hellboy again. Definitely recommend trying the pizza with hot honey here!', 'Food: 4/5\nWow wow wow! I\'m so lucky I got to eat here. We ordered the Dellboy, the Monte Cristo, the King Harry and the Brisket. The Dellboy (5/5) was overwhelmingly delicious. It was soft yet crispy, tangy and a bit spicy. This was my fav and I highly  recommend it! The Monte Cristo (1/5) was not for me. It was way too sweet for my liking. I took one bite and had to stop because the maple syrup was too overpowering. The King Harry (4/5) was light, salty and loaded with presutto! I love presutto as-is so I knew this would be a delicious treat. The Brisket looked beautiful (came loaded with pink pickled onions) but I didn\'t sample it. The smell of the bbq sauce was too much for me. (I\'m not a fan of bbq sauce.) All their pizzas are thin crust (which is my preference) and delivered fresh. I was a bit hesitant to try another ""hipster"" pizza establishment since my last experience at Robertas but I would give Pauliee Gee\'s another try! I think the secret is in their sauce!!\n\nService: 4/5\nVery accommodating staff. They did a great job changing their business model due to covid.

In particular there isn't any ordered lines to the front.. in fact the front is setup on the left and people have to walk up to the cashier on the right so often the staff just pick out people they see in the crowd and ask for their orders. This quite annoying when they end up picking people who arrive later but just so happen to be in the staffs line of sight. This has happened a few times for me in the past and severely offended one of my friends when I showed them this place once. Besides the line situation it also feels like they have difficulty keeping orders, it has not been uncommon for me to have to clarify what I ordered previously because they were trying to juggle 100 or so other orders. It just feels chaotic here, especially when it's a crowded day.\n\nBut besides that this place does offer good coffee and food. The breakfast sandwiches in particular are nice and I can't think of a coffee shop that offers something like that around the area. They also offer a unique dirty chai which I like. It's just not enough though for me to come back here considering the service.\n\nI can see why people would like this place but I can't honestly recommend it considering there is so much competition for coffee shops in the area. The chaotic feeling I get of this place doesn't help at all either."", 'Ordered a breakfast takeout.

It took 20 minutes for everything to get prepared and packed, so that I just grabbed everything, paid check and enjoyed my breakfast. Friendly staff, strong coffee, just to my liking.

No issues. Just a note, food does come as is in the photo, and if you'd like additional, there is a minimum of $1.50 additional. I was confused when I ordered at first for one of the silver cups (spicy salmon). I thought that it didn't come with cucumber or avocado, but I didn't realize that it came like that and that was additional toppings.\n\nFood description was confusing that's all. Also, I wasn't sure the sizing was for the silver cup orders, but it's the size of a medium coffee cup. Wish there was something to scale to size you know?

I arrived to their takeout window and was informed that during NY on PAUSE they are taking orders online only. It was an easy enough process and my order was ready in under 10 minutes, but I recommend ordering ahead of time for a swift pick up.\n\nOf the three bowls available the Fisherman's bowl-- with three types of fish plus snow crab, eel, roe, omelet, avocado, scallions, and pickled radish-- definitely seemed like the most exciting pick. When I dug into my bowl though, pretty as it was, I noticed several ingredients missing. No avocado, roe, or eel was present in the bowl, which makes the $17+ price point for the bowl seem that much less palatable. Still, the bowl was really tasty, especially with crispy tempura topping thrown on top. I was satiated, though I felt mislead. Resources must be scarce in pandemic times so I'll cut them a break.\n\nThey also sell fish over rice options in smaller cups at the very reasonable price point of $6-$9, depending on the cup, which would make for a perfect savory snack. Get a takeaway from here and walk it over to Prospect Park to enjoy on a nice day for a nice little afternoon."", ""Got delivery from here for the first time. The sushi tasted pre-made and not fresh. Each roll was in its own container which makes me think they're not made to order. The three rolls I got were not good at all, very disappointing."", '4 stars + 1 star for the novelty.  I am definitely a fan!\n\nThe ""signature"" at Silver Rice is the sushi cups, which are basically sushi in poke form.  All the ingredients tasted really clean and fresh, and the cups are actually a decent portion of everything.  Key word is cups.  It\'s a fun idea, but the small cup doesn\'t leave much room for mixing and getting a nice mixed up bite every time.  I get 1 or 2 cups with a small miso soup most of the time, and that makes up a decently filling meal.\n\nThe place itself is really small with very limited seating inside and a few picnic tables outside.

The fish tastes so fresh that you can taste its own natural sweetness. The eel roll had just the right amount of sauce on it without being overpowered; you can taste the eel. The yellowtail and negi roll was also really delicious without tasting too green oniony. The only downside was that Silver Rice forgot our miso soup order.\n\nBesides that, if you want delicious sushi that is fresh, choose Silver Rice!"", 'Very consistent, solid high quality rolls with plenty of fish and not too much rice.

Here's a piece of advice: get an extra side of it to dip your sandwich.  The 2nd best I've had was John's Deli in Gravesend, but their gravy is heavier.  \n\nDefontes has set the bar high and even thinking about it is making me long for the next time I can visit this middle-of-nowhere place!"", ""There are a few nostalgic genres of restaurants that have gradually been disappearing from the streets of New York City. The Jewish deli, the corner diner...and the old school Italian sandwich shop, with unimaginably generous portions. DeFonte's fits squarely in this category, somehow having escaped the changing times on this desolate, inland corner of Red Hook.\n\nBut the crowds continue to come, and the sandwiches are excellent. My hearty fresh loaf played host to a combination of sweet, homemade roasted peppers, thin slices of provolone, and a heaping of perfectly-textured eggplant cutlets that at other sandwich purveyors might have succumbed to soggyness.\n\nWell worth the trip, and I'd recommend bringing a friend willing to share your sandwich."", ""I came here a couple years ago and was delighted! Earlier this year I made a stop after an IKEA run, and ended up getting food poisoning. I did report it, but I'm sure if anything came to fruition with the board. Everything tasted delicious going down. I am all for a hot chicken Parm hoagie. And it might have just been a one off situation, since I know they have a loyal base."", ""This is my second time here. What you get for the price and the quality and service is amazing but I got a fried chicken club sandwich and it gave me mild food poisoning. Another sandwich we got this time around was the load in Italian and it was piled high with meats and didn't make us sick. Not sure if it was the lettuce or something else in my sandwich but I won't order it again."", 'Best sandos in BK, hands down. Classic.', ""I'm HOOKED on these sandwiches. I've been to Defontes more times than I can count (at least four times) and every sandwich I've had has been excellent. Having had the chicken parm, Redhook special, and Nicky special, my personal favorite is the roast beef with thick mozzarella and gravy (more like au jus). It just gets get me GOING.\n\nThey offer 1/3 and 1/2 sizes for all sandwiches, but with such a small price difference for such a big size difference, there is legitimately no reason to ever get a small. Not in this economy. Go big and then go home, with a juicy meatster."", ""When I think of Defontes, I think of the word transcendent. This experience brings you to the next level of Italian Delis. It is the final boss level of classic New York establishments. I dream about my eggplant parm from this spot and its been 3 months.\n\nWe found Defontes on the way to Red Hook Winery, on leisurely walking tour of Brooklyn. There are no seats-it is just a mile long counter with an equally long menu and daily specials. GRATEFULLY the special of the day was fried shrimp in red sauce and oh my god has there ever been a better dish made? The small option of sandwich is enough food for two people--we could've done a large for 3 to be honest. BUT thankfull it comes wrapped up in a bag, so we just took the leftovers home and enjoyed them the next day. Do you know what was also a surprise hit? The macaroni and potato salad were out of this world. That is not to say that the sandwiches were not---they are beyond words---but it was a true delight to be craving some macaroni salad and have it be an original, freshly made concoction of deliciousness.\n\nWe took our sandwiches and sat outside in the parking lot, but another option is to take them straight to the Red Hook Winery, where you can enjoy great wine with your great food. Cannot wait to go back!"", ""Really good I had a chicken parmesan sandwich omg. Damn the sauce everything was good that's all I can say."", ""Defontes don't play. In a neighborhood of many exceptional Italian delis, Defontes is a stand out.\n\nService is friendly and quick. Meats, cheeses, fried eggplant, stuffed peppers are so fresh and flavorful. Get the hot salad on EVERYTHING!\n\nThe egg/potato breakfast sandwich was a perfect and hearty breakfast nosh. The Italian combo with added eggplant...what can I say?

This is our second visit, and as we'd hired a car, we drove out to Red Hook from the East Village just to eat at Mazzat.\n\nMy boyfriend is Iranian so we eat a lot of Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean food both out in restaurants around the city, while traveling around the world, and at home. The food at Mazzat is among the highest quality and tastiest that we have eaten.\n\nOne thing that makes the food stand out is that everything has its own unique taste. Everything from the rice, to the sides, to the meat has its own carefully balanced flavors.\n\nThere are some great options for special diets here too. I ate gluten free kebabs and they took care to check allergy requirements. There are also plenty of options if you follow, say, a keto or LCHF diet (low carb high fat diet). For example, they have sides such as roasted cauliflower, roasted Brussels sprouts and salads, so even if you are keeping your carbs low, there are plenty of uniquely cooked sides to fill up on, all with their own special flavors.\n\nThe service is great too. Both times we ate here they took great care of us. The owner is the chef. He's been running this place for 15 years and you can taste the love for the food. He understands the subtle balance of flavors, which is a real art.\n\nAnd if there is one recommendation not to miss it is the dates wrapped in bacon. Sometimes they have them as a special with cheese (I think it was Brie). This is not to be missed!\n\nAlso, we visited here in COVID times and everything is really well socially distanced. Eating out in Manhattan at these times is pretty hectic, but if you want to calm your nervous system, it's totally worth taking a trip in the car to this place to get a bit of peace and calm. They took reservations (even for 2 people) so it's really worth the trip."", ""We were looking for a spot with good falafels and thankfully stumbled upon this one. All the food we ordered was delicious and of the freshest ingredients. The falafels were soft and moist inside yet had a nice crispy texture on the outside. We normally do not like stuffed grape leaves because we often find them bitter, but these were terrific and we would order them again. The hummus and babaganoush were excellent! Probably the best we've ever had. Interesting the pita was whole wheat and it felt so healthy. I loved the large chunks of feta in the Greek salad.\n\nWe had the food delivered and the delivery fee was very descent. The food is a bit expensive, but the quality was definitely worth the price."", ""Absolutely blown away by how delicious the food is at Mazzat. We ordered takeout from here the other night and it was a lovely experience. My family enjoyed the meal so much that we plan on adding Mazzat to our weekly takeout rotation.\n\nI highly recommend the falafel -- hands-down best falafel of my life. It was crispy on the outside but perfectly smooth in the middle. Insanely good and came with a nice helping of pita.\nthe shish-kabob was also awesome and came with rice and Brussel sprouts(my favorite!!). So delicious and flavorful.\nThe baklava was also OUTSTANDING- cannot stress this enough, you MUST get this! absolutely love it.\n\nThe people that work here are very nice, and the food is seriously out of this world. I can't say anything about the atmosphere or service, but the takeout experience was awesome. I can't wait to eat here again; check Mazzat out for your next meal out!"", ""I've been walking past this place for too long and finally stopped in. Super friendly owner and staff. The chef (I'm assuming also the owner) stopped by to talk to me about the whole fish and I'm glad he talked me into it. Super tender, dunked in a bunch of olive oil, lemon and paprika, with charred skin.

It's a mashup of interpretations of Middle Eastern cuisine. Although we've never had the same server more than once, It was extraordinary on the three occasions that we've been here.\n\nI love their homemade condiments but the emulsified citrus salad dressing is so good, I ask the waitstaff for 3 additional little ramekins immediately because I know I'll be using it on everything I order."", 'This was first time eating traditional Egyptian food and I quite enjoyed it.

Hits the spot without overfilling you. As for the entrees, any of the pasta dishes satisfy to perfection. I don't normally get pasta dishes when I'm out at restaurants because it's so overpriced when you can make gourmet pasta at home for 1/4 of the price. But Krupa does something special with their dishes and the flavor combo is always outstanding. My favorite ricotta gnocchi -- but always take a peak at their pasta specials.

I'd only knock it down to a four star, because some of the other entrees/appetizers are just so/so.

Cabbage slaw and chive aioli also worked really well on the burger.\nI wasn't as big a fan of the Double Stack Lamb Burger unfortunately (3.5/5), mainly because I thought the goat gouda was too strong.

The same few dishes appear on pretty much every table because everyone knows what's good for them.\n\nMy friend and I had a hard time limiting how much food we ordered, because we felt like we could eat ourselves into oblivion with dishes like the Cod Croquettes, Risotto Balls, and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. We decided on this day what we couldn't live without were the Breakfast Gnocchi, Panko Crusted Shrimp Burger, and the Quiche with Lox and Creme Fraiche. The shrimp burger was the most delicious of our choices, with a little bit of zest from the relish to offset the crispy, fried flavor of the burger and a healthy kick that came from the spicy chive aioli. This alone would be worth going out of your way for. I'd make the same argument for the gnocchi, which was extraordinarily tender and rich in the best way. If I could go back in time I'd skip the quiche and order the lemon ricotta pancakes instead.\n\nEven at 11am we had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table, so this place is far from being a hidden gem.

The baby octopus was delicious, served with what I could only guess is tomatillo sauce, and potatoes. Definitely a good little plate to split. We also split the fish plate with cured salmon, another good choice for a light bite.\n\nI'm so happy I found Blueprint. I'll definitely be back!"", ""Oh Blueprint, you will always hold a special place in my heart. It was here that I first met my fiancé and had some of the best cocktails I've ever tried. Nestled in the first neighborhood I lived in when I moved to the city, it's quite the find for ParkSlope.\n\nIn an area pretty crowded with sports bars not far from the Barclays Center, it offers a welcomed change of pace. Blueprint's classic and old-school charm carries far and wide in all of their drinks, food and service and I'm so so happy I found you. Or should I say found me. It is the perfect date spot. So for my 100th review I will write about you.\n\nOh where to begin, I suppose a good place would be the cocktails. They have a great selection of specialty drinks that range from a delicious grapefruit drink to a classic manhattan. We usually like to start the night off with happy hour which is pretty great with decent priced wine, beer and cocktails. They even offer little tasty bites. My fiancé will get the chicken liver mouse and I will get the hummus. His and hers and oh so delicious! We usually go for the baby octopus as well!\n\nNow theres so many different ways to go about the food selections. We've tried almost everything and keep coming back for more! The pork sliders speak right to my southern soul and the rabbit pot pie is right up my fiancées alley. Or you do a classic meat and cheese platter with large selection of artisan cheeses and delicatessen meats. They even offer desserts. We tried the bread pudding the last time we were in and can I say it was love at first bite?\n\nI don't really have a bad thing to say about this place. Go here. Drink up and fill your bellies with the best this neighborhood has to offer. Take it from me you won't regret it!""]",,[],https://www.yelp.com/biz/blueprint-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Great flavorful and filling meal but a couple misses\nFour of us ate together in total. We each ordered a bowl and then some dishes to share in the middle. It came out to just over 100 after fees and tax and tip. There was so much food and it was so tasty that it was well worth the cost!\n\nI got the braised pork bowl and it was super flavorful and well seasoned. The lean parts were a little dry but the fatty parts made up for it.\nThe baos had a lot of stuffing and came with enough for everyone in our party to have 2 of each. The fried chicken had a great flavor but they kept the container closed so the trapped steam lost a lot of the crunchiness.\n\nMy other qualm was with the wildrice. I know its inherently got a weird texture but I was hoping they would finesse it so itd taste better. It felt very dry and almost like leftover rice, had to mix soy sauce with it to be palatable.\n\nAll in all when things open back up this place would be 100% better in person, but even as takeout its worth a family meal.', 'The food is amazing! The delivery was fast!\nCucumber salad is a must! Beef and onion dumplings - wow!!!! Definitely will order again! Thank you!', ""Extremely solid place. Have only done delivery and only during COVID. Reasonably priced and filling. I could eat their cucumber salad as a meal, if I'm full and deciding what to finish it's always that! Is it spicy? No but the point is a palate cleanser - it's so refreshing and I can't get enough of it.\n\nMy fiancé loves the beef dumplings, I prefer the veggie ones or shrimp but that's just a preference thing. Obviously the soup dumplings are where it's at and can confirm all the dumplings taste great reheated!\n\nChicken wings, string beans, and popcorn chicken are all great as well. The galbi beef in the rice bowl is sooo flavorful. I liked the dumplings better but that's because I was specifically in the mood for that. You honestly can't go wrong with anything."", ""Great store. The steamed blue crab and pork soup dumpling is definitely a bomb, it tasted SO delicious! It's very worth to try.\n\nI ordered the pan fried pork and chive dumpling, pan fried shrimp and pork soup dumpling, steamed crab and pork soup dumpling and the popcorn chicken. Everything just taste so so so good!!!!!!!!!"", ""Ordered a bunch of stuff. What shines are the popcorn chicken, dumplings and baos. Not surprising. The soup dumplings are flavorful. The wrapping is on the thicker side. Some love that. Some don't. The soy sauce with vinegar had a nice bite with bits of ginger as expected. They provided excellent packaging which is a huge plus for the soup dumplings. Thank you for the high quality disposable dishes and utensils that even include a soup spoon!\n\nThe only dish I was disappointed with was the braised kalbi beef. While the marinade tasted right, the cut of the beef is wrong. They used cheaper beef stew cuts which is problematic if you're going to call a dish kalbi. Kalbi must use short ribs. It's supposed to be rich and fatty. Full stop. For 13 dollars, I should have known better. Short ribs are expensive and there's no way you can buy true kalbi for that cheap. Otherwise, the egg was boiled for me which is a little odd as Koreans only do that for cold noodle dishes like naengmyun but I guess this is a fusion shop.\n\nI think the rest of the menu is probably pretty solid. Just avoid the kalbi dish if you are expecting something leaning towards the authentic side."", 'The delivery really held up! I was skeptical that soup dumplings would hold with delivery as they seem like a real ""eat then while they\'re hot and fresh"" kind of situation, but they were really good. I got the pork and I\'d get them again for sure.\n\nI also got the bao trio - loved the beef and pork ones, not nuts about the flavor of the veggie one (and I\'m a veggie lover, I\'m not like a crazy meat eater or anything so it\'s uncharacteristic for me to not like the veggie option). Something about the flavor was a little off. But the other two bao were very good and the texture/consistency of the bun was especially above average.\n\nI\'ll definitely order from here again!', ""This place is LEGIT! We ordered Chicken & cabbage boiled dumplings, popcorn shrimp, pork & crab soup dumpling, pork & chive pan fried dumplings, beef & onion pan fried dumplings, cucumber salad, and string beans. All were seasoned very well.\n\nThe only thing was the popcorn shrimp came soggy-but that's because it's probably not a good dish to order delivered since it's all steamy inside the container. The flavoring was great.\n\nI would order here again for dumplings any time the craving hits. All the other dumpling shops in the nabe cannot compare to Mr. Bao."", ""Park Slope finally has soup dumplings and I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER!\n\nThis space is pretty cool. It was the old Nunu Chocolates space, and they've done a great job taking advantage of it. They have a backyard, and the kitchen is right up front so you can watch them at work, which is always entertaining.\n\nThey've got a bathroom near the back, and some sidewalk seating out front. So lots of places to wait!\n\nThe blue crab and pork soup dumplings were very solid. We got two orders, and one wasn't as warm as the other one, which burnt a lot of mouth roofs. But totally worth it!"", 'Delivery was fast and arrived piping hot. I really liked the fried shrimp and pork soup dumpling.\nThe steamed pork soup dumplings were good, but I did notice the soup was either absorbed by the dough or had leaked. Some that retained the soup were amazing though. I would definitely order again. Packaged with care and the utensils were good quality.', ""The only thing from my order that was worth rating 5* was the chicken wings.\nWe ordered the blue crab & pork soup dumpling, the chef's mixed platter, also got 2 of the rice bowls - the pork and the beef.\n\nThe pork belly was better than the beef for sure. The mushrooms are seasoned weird or maybe just taste weird. The soup dumplings and the other dumplings from the chefs platter were just bland.\n\nEverything else was ok, compared to the rest of the raving reviews maybe I just didn't order correctly.""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-bao-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

The noodles options were soba/ udon with veggies - I loved the okra!\nI also got hot tea on the house, and checking in on Yelp for the first time gives you edamame for a starter.', ""1 star atmosphere but 3.5 star sushi and service. Musashi was a great find in the Williamsburg area, literally steps away from the Metropolitan stop on the G train.\n\nIt was very quiet since it was Monday night but there was no lacking of service, quality and presentation of the sushi.\nWe got things started with a dry/light cold sake. It was crisp and delicious and offered plenty of servings in the cutest mini  champagne-like glasses.\n\nA Yelp check in perk was the Edamame appetizer. Standard and identical to all Japanese restaurants, but nevertheless, a nice accompaniment to nibble on and include with the  meal.\nShrimp Shumai was the additional app we ordered. Again, similar to those served at other restaurants.\n\nFor main, we shared the Chirashi. This was served unlike others I've had in the past which was usually arranged in a deep bowl, rice on the bottom and layered with the variety of seafood on top.\nTheirs was served on the same dish as the Shrimp Tempura roll.\n\nThe Chirashi included 15 slices of seafood, radish and egg garnished with spiraled radish and a small serving of seasoned rice. The fish was fresh and although it was presented aesthetically appealing with flowers and leaves, I prefer my chirashi served in the traditional manner.\n\nThe Shrimp Tempura roll was good but not unlike other ones I've tried elsewhere. The roll was cut into 5 pieces and drizzled with the brown sauce most tempura rolls have.\nVery good.\n\nMusashi is a solid restaurant to try if in the area. With the menu being lengthy, we played it quick and safe but I'd return to explore other dishes and rolls."", ""Musashi is the bomb dot com.\n\nI had a big sushi craving and found Musashi on Yelp. I was staying down the street, so I walked on over on a Sunday night and luckily snagged a table right away.\n\nFood-wise, I decided to try the mango shrimp hand roll and the neptune roll (shrimp tempura, snow crab, eel, avocado, tobiko, tempura flakes, wrapped in marble seaweed). Both of these rolls were DELISH and so, so filling. The hand roll was stuffed to the brim and didn't skimp out on any of the shrimp, mango, and sauce. The neptune roll was large and filled with flavor. I thought maybe the shrimp tempura, snow crab and eel would be too much seafood in one roll, but it actually all complimented each other really well. Between both these dishes, I was perfect amount of full and content.\n\nEverything from the ambiance, to the service, to the food, makes this visit 5-stars from me!"", ""This sushi spot is very spacey. Looks about standard in terms of decor. However, when I walked in, first thing I noticed was it was sweltering hot. Like really uncomfortable. It got better while I was there though so maybe they lowered the heat. The sushi was okay. Nothing to write home about. The service was slow which wasn't really acceptable considering we were the only people in the restaurant. Overall, it was fine. Am I rushing to come back? Probably not.\n\nOne thing that was nice was the check in free edamame and the free orange slices given to us at the end of our meal. Other than that, just average."", 'Food was made very quickly and absolutely delicious. Would 100% recommend.

It is simply the best in the city and the best I have had anywhere.  Surely we all can agree that ""penne"" Alla vodka is as much a prototypical NY food as a bagel, slice of pizza, or black and white cookie.

The unctuous sauce clings perfectly to the expertly cooked to perfection noodles, which have the platonic amount of snap to achieve al dente perfection.

Yesterday so happened to be Thursday so I decided to check it out. I\'ve personally heard good reviews of Lan Ting from my friends who are local to Sunset Park. I gave them a call about 30 min prior to going there (1000% insist that you do this if you\'re going on the special days (Wed/Thur) or weekends!!!) and we got a table quickly. That\'s unfortunately not the case for all those who came after us. They had a long wait. Once inside, my friend and I were immediately greeted by a friendly, handsome fella named Raymond, who was our server for the remainder of the night. The food was great and the variety as mind-blowing. They also do free birthday specials just like their competitor 99. Would definitely come back in the near future, or as my friend said, ""already planning for my birthday next year.""\n\nAnita\'s recommended must-try\'s:\n\n* fatty beef - any Asian would be able to tell you this is a hotpot must, the ones in Lan Ting have a higher ratio of fat (which I prefer, more fat = more flavor)\n* shrimp paste - amaazzzing texture. The friend that I was with is a chef and restaurateur himself and he, too, applauded the impeccable consistency of this shrimp. (LOL moment at dinner: my friend took some cooked shrimp paste and wrapped it in slightly soaked fried tofu skin to imitate a popular dim sum)\n* clams - even though it\'s AYCE, this place doesn\'t skimp on quality. Normally at restaurants, you\'d find littleneck clams (clams about the size of a quarter) but they gave ACTUAL big-a**  quahog clams here. Very meaty and juicy.

I always opt for more seafood (the lobster balls are DIVINE) and my carnivore boyfriend loves all the meat options. They also have a lot of veggie options, more so than in other spots (arugula, spinach, and pumpkin are just some of our favs). Service is always spectacular and they fulfill our ""re-fill"" requests quickly.', ""My review is for the outdoor dining experience due to covid. I came here this past weekend on a Saturday with a party of 3 for outdoor dining with a reservation at 2:45PM. We were not seated until about half an hour later. The staff was apologetic about the situation though.\n\nWhen we sat down, it took a while for our food that we ordered to come. The waiter was kind and apologized so we overlooked it. The menu is pretty expansive and a lot of variety. The sauces station is covered my plastic outside which I appreciated. Once the food came, I was impressed by the quality of the meats, veggies, seafood, etc. However, it was a bit chilly and it took awhile for the broth to boil and the awning they had wasn't sufficient enough to block out the wind. We still tried our very best to enjoy our meal, which we did. I like how they were able to give us hot tea.\n\nFor all you can eat, the price is very decent. It came out to around $30 pp, including tip and tax for the three of us.\n\nIf we did not have to wait that long in the beginning, I would have given this place 4 stars because the food alone deserves 4, but the overall experience comes out to be 3. There's currently other hotpot places that have better service with outdoor dining.\n\nI feel that once indoor dining comes along, I'd come back and I would definitely enjoy my time here much more as well."", ""If I could give this place more then 5 stars I would. My friend and I came here after we biked around Brooklyn and wanted something that would satisfy our appetite and meet our budget needs.\n\nThey have two floors. The ground floor and the basement. Personally, I prefer the basement more as I think their decor was better. Our waiter, Jason, was very attentive. When we sat, he immediately opened up a wet towelette for us to whipe our hands with and asked if we would like a plastic bag to avoid any possible bbq smell should someone opt to grill. They also offered us an apron in case we stained our clothing, while cooking, so that was a nice touch.\n\nAs for the menu, I love that they have pictures of the dishes for us to choose from and there were a lot to choose from too. The quality of the meat was very good and fresh. Their shrimp was huge and their crab was delicious and sweet. I love their fried tofu skin and their shrimp paste. Unlike other places, I could actually see so much bits of shrimp in it and that took both my friend and I by surprised.\n\nThey also offered individual pots or shared if you're looking for dual broth flavor. As for their dipping station, I liked that they gave suggestions on how to combine the dips for a unique flavor.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with this hotpot restaurant and can see why they received such stellar reviews."", ""Made reservations at 6:30pm but didn't get the table until 6:50pm.

There are many reservations in the same time-period,  we schedule the seating based on whoever arrives first within their reserved time period.\n3.

It was extremely rude and disrespectful. I didn't bother saying anything to the manager since it was already the end of the day ( really regret not. )\n\nI was extremely disappointed this time with Lan Ting Hotpot because I was debating to go to Lao jie hotpot or LanTing Hotpot. Clearly I've chosen the wrong spot that night.\n\nJust to be clear it wasn't my first time coming to Lan Ting Hotpot but it was my first time coming close to 12 am. During dinner time 6-8:30ish they had great service ( maybe it's because it's rush hour for dinner and all the waiter is trying to get most tip ) but this time service was unbelievable."", ""One of my favorite hotpot places! This place is pretty similar to laojie. Service is equally as great and the prices are about the same. The decor here is more modern while laojie is more rustic and olden times.\n\nThey give you a hair tie (though mine looked used and had hair on it). Their special sauce is really good. They also have bubble tea drinks here which I love!! Their food selection is pretty good as well.\n\nI came for an early lunch so it wasn't packed at all. But if you come for dinner, I highly recommend you make a reservation.\n\nOverall, I don't really see a difference b/w here and laojie. I would go to both interchangeably. Laojie serves dessert while this place doesn't but they have good drinks here (bubble tea) aside from the normal watermelon juice and stuff.""]",,[],https://www.yelp.com/biz/lan-ting-hotpot-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

I finally did, last weekend.  I had high expectations.  The reviews, the photos, the reputation....  Obviously, it's Fall 2020, so it's COVID times.  They do not offer inside dining.  They had street dining, about 4 tables, with Lil heaters about 6 feet above the tables.  I did feel cold, because the heater above my table wasn't on.  But, the hostess, turned it on 4 me, and very slowly warmed up.  Anyway, about ten minutes in, I didn't realize you have to order the food at the window.  I just thought, they were a lil busy.  The hostess 4got to mention, that..  I ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower, The Chic Pea Ranch Sandwich, Lemonade and my brother got Pot Pie.  It took about 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  It kinda felt king waiting.  Maybe, cuz it was chilly.  The food came out in boxes.  The fork was pretty wrapped, with one napkin.  The food we order, required more napkins.  The cauliflower was a lil spicier than I like.  I expect a lil better.  It was kinda soggy.  The sandwich was okay.  But, the bread was awful.  I expected a better quality bread.  It was plain, white bread.  Kinda like Italian bread.  The purple lemonade was ok, but I had to use the bathroom, so I stopped drinking it.  ML doesn't allow their guests to use the bathroom.  So, it can be an uncomfortable experience.  Their desserts sounded very good, but didn't try any.  I ended up taking the cauliflower and on of the chic pea patties home.  Much latter in the evening, I put the patty on a Hawaiian roll, and I enjoyed it.  I only took one piece of the cauliflower home.  I tree a bunch of pieces out.  I dipped it in the ranch sauce.  I needed that.  I still don't think I would order it, and I'm surprised so many people raved on it.  Overall, I thought I would be amazed by ML.  I think, I will try again when in door dining is back.  Their outdoor dining is uncomfortable,,\n\nIt is a cashless business.  I was told, that as of Nov 28, 2020, that's illegal in NYC.  However, you can tip in cash.  The hostess said the staff prefers cash tips,"", ""I got take out last night and tried a few different things. The Caesar salad, the classic Mac n cheese, and the fried mushroom and gravy dish.\n\nI primarily eat plant-based so I try to seek out restaurants like this. I have to say, I wasn't blown away, but I did enjoy the meal. The flavors didn't necessarily stick out to me, but it was satisfying.\n\nI would come back and give this place another try!"", 'The roommates and I ordered ML for delivery (COVID, duh).\n\nK.I.S.S.: The cauli-wings were amazing. I feel like this is on the menu of practically every vegan spot ever and they\'re usually pretty good, but ML does them really well. Their hot sauce is truly great. Additionally, the bucket brings A LOT. Three of us shared them and there were still leftovers. It also comes with a side of sliced small carrots, celery, and homemade ranch that none of us were really into (the ranch, that is).\nI really enjoyed my mushroom burger. I\'m not into the whole ""let\'s eat fake meat that tastes like meat,"" since I\'m not a vegan and would just eat a cheeseburger if I wanted meat, so I loved that it very much tasted like super hearty mushroom. It was really delicious. A little too much bread, but I\'d eat it again. Also, v. filling.\nThe lemonade was great, although honestly, it just tasted like great lemonade. I don\'t know about this whole butterfly pea flower stuff, sounds like a trick to get people to buy more lemonade. It\'s also way less vibrant in color than the one pictured on their menu.\n\nRoommates seemed to enjoy their food, although they said they preferred Champs over ML. ML feels healthier.\n\nFinally, we did have an issue with our order. We ordered the Pumpkin Sundae, but it never arrived. When we called the restaurant to let them know, they said they\'d have to charge us an additional delivery fee to send it back out, which is just nonsense. Why would you even suggest that when it\'s the restaurant\'s fault? Eat the cost or immediately suggest a refund. I understand it\'s a crazy time (and the poor girl on the phone sounded insanely busy), but don\'t suggest ridiculous things. We eventually got a refund.\n\nAnyways, all good. Eat here. You won\'t hate it.', 'A soft three.\n\nOrdered the lemonade, garlic parm seitan wings, and chickpea hero. The lemonade was refreshing, but the food extremely salty. It overtook the flavors that I had imagined would come from the ingredients used. Maybe I\'m not used to seitan, but had Chiky Francese with chickpea cutlets (not from here) last week, so I know that doesn\'t naturally yield saltiness.\n\nI think I would come back and try something different. Not sure. Wish they sold chips and guac as a side.\n\nService was quick through the window. I was offered water but didn\'t get any lol Make sure you ask the people waiting around are they in line, because it\'s unclear where the line starts.\n\nThere is a sidewalk deck with 4 tables that sit 2 people each. There\'s a sign that reads ""wait for table to be sanitized,"" but I didn\'t see that happening.', ""I'm usually very excited to experience vegan restaurants as I was the day I ventured over to Modern Love. The reviews raved about how amazing the food was not my take. It was a chilly day out so this may have contributed to the not so great experience. We ordered:\nFried Mozzarella (5 stars) I loved this but my friend thought it tasted too much like coconut. But I personal would order this again.\nOyster Mushroom Calamari - eh this was okay. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce it was served with.\nMushroom Fried Chick'n - This was pretty good, the cauliflower mash was tasty\nCauliflower Buffalo Mac - The best item we ordered.

Tried the filet mignon, porterhouse, ribeye, and NY Strip while here. The biggest cons would be that the sides and especially the desserts are lackluster in both variety and in quality/flavor; they also do not have any soft drinks, only alcoholic beverages. But as far as the main course goes, this is the place to come to if you're really just looking for quality steak. I usually get my steaks medium rare or medium, but there is no medium-anything here--only rare or well done, no in between. For some reason everything above rare here tasted very dried out. But the rare, which I am usually not the biggest fan of, was incredible here.\n\nFinal verdict: would return, would recommend."", ""I came here with my husband and in-laws recently for dinner. This was my husbands third time coming - he's a big fan! We all had a lovely time and everyone agreed the food was delicious and the service was a delight.\n\nI don't eat meat so I got the Caesar salad and the shrimp scampi as my meal. The Caesar salad came with a TON of freshly grated parmesan cheese (yum!) and the shrimp scampi was very flavorful. Everyone else got steak and said it was juicy and cooked to perfection.\n\nI knocked off 1 star because some of the seats at our outdoor table weren't very sturdy, especially compared to those at tables nearby.

In the future I'd recommend making sure all seats are comfortable and the same height at each table.\n\nWe'll still be back!"", 'Lovely restaurant with outdoor seating with plenty of seats. We booked a reservation through Open Table and when we arrived we were seated right away. We ordered the boneless ribeye, t-bone steak, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. All the food came out very quickly! Both steaks were delicious, but I felt that each could have used a bit more salt. I did prefer the boneless ribeye over the t-bone. The creamed spinach were tasty and not too heavy on the cream in my opinion. I really really enjoyed the mashed potatoes! Sometimes mashed potatoes can be overpowered by the butter and milk, but this one was perfect. As we were celebrating my bday, they gave us a free slice for cheesecake. Very kind of them. The cheesecake was yummy! Not overly sweet. The service was great too! Btw, the bread they serve for the table was super good. I really enjoyed the olives in the bread!', 'I took my bestfriend here for his birthday.\nWhen we walked we were immediately greeted by my first name (the name on the reservation).\nEveryone had a mask on and the tables were nicely spread out.

Made reservations on opentable literally 2 days before with no problems.\n\nwe ordered 3 different cuts of steak to share and 4 sides.\n\nPorterhouse for two: we ordered it medium rare. When it first came out on a sizzling heated plate, it smelled and looked delicious and it was cooked medium rare. The waiter explained to us that there were 2 parts to the porterhouse. Part tenderloin (filet mignon) and part strip steak. He served us the strip first and it tasted really good and the texture was just right. The meat was easy to chew with just the right amount of fat/meat.  Then as time went by, the tenderloin pieces actually got cooked on the plate to medium done. I typically dont like tenderloin because its lean meat with no fat, and unsurprisingly I wasn't fond of these pieces, especially when it got overcooked on the plate. It was dry. So just word of advice, make sure you dont let the meat sit too long on the hot plate.\n\nT-bone steak- delicious and flavorful. Most of the people on the table actually said this was their favorite.\n\nBone in rib eye- also enjoyable. The surface was slightly charred which gave it a more unique/different flavor compared to the porterhouse.\n\nSteak sauce complimented all the steaks well.\n\nGnocchi side-pretty good. Not too heavy.\nCreamed spinach- also pretty good and not too heavy.\nFrench fries-nice and crispy\nMushroom mix- decent.\nOverall, food was 4/5.\nService is 5 stars! I mentioned on opentable that it was my husband's birthday. After we finished our dinner, the waiters/busboys cleaned the table. Then surprised us with a slice of cheesecake with a candle. It was a really nice gesture. Then we ordered the creme brulee and carrot cake with walnuts. My favorite dessert was probably the cheesecake. It is flavorful and wasn't too heavy compared to other cheesecakes. Waiters were super nice and helpful in educating us about the steaks and providing us with recommendations."", ""Ya'll. You know that other famous steakhouse that won't be mentioned here that is pricey AF and you can't get reservations at cause its always booked and busy. GO TO AMBER STEAK HOUSE.\nOrder yourself a porterhouse for two and compliment me on this suggestion cause I can guarantee it's probably one of the best if not the BEST cut of meat you've put in your mouth.\nHusband made reservations for our anni.

Steak for birthday lunch?! Yes PLEASE!\n\nTheir menu is limited, but everything is ""fantastic"" as this is Janet\'s favorite adjective for this place.  I wanted to have something reasonable for lunch, and if I was gonna be bad, I was gonna include fries.  I opted for the steak sandwich with a side of fries and their famous steak sauce.  Insert the word ""fantastic"" here.\n\nFrench fries are usually more ""ehh"" then ""YUM"" with me, but these fries, you will NOT want to share!  They were perfectly fried and not greasy in the slightest.  The steak was on the softest hero bread, with moistness and tenderness of meaty joy.  A MUST HAVE.  When you first get the portion, my fat cells were like, ""You\'re gonna still be hungry, Jac; don\'t kid yourself"", but I couldn\'t of been more wrong.  This is the BEST portion to have for lunch, and in order to fully enjoy this to maximum capacity, getting any more than this would be an utter sin.\n\nI hope it\'s someone else\'s birthday really soon so we can celebrate the steak sandwich...err umm, I mean that person....YEAH.....']",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/amber-steak-house-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

From what I read here, their food is made to order, and it was definitely fresh tasting as could be.\n\nMy one minor complaint would be that the food was a little heavier on the oil than I prefer, but that definitely won't stop me from ordering again.\n\nLast point - they are feeding people in the community during the pandemic! I don't know the details, but my neighborhood Facebook group has been raving about this charitable act which is how I discovered this place to begin with. This makes me feel even better about spending my money with them.\n\nCheck them out!"", 'Everything is so, so good. I dream of the paneer and okra and am convinced I will never find another place with flavors that I found at Jalsa. This food is outstanding and I hope it weathers this hard time for the city to see the other end of it. Go support them and be sure to overeat to keep them thriving. Thank you, Jalsa, for sharing your talents with us!', ""My new favorite Indian place! It is such a hidden gym in Brooklyn. We went to the restaurant once and ordered delivery here for several time after. The experience was absolutely amazing every single time.\n\nThis is a family owned business. The owner was super friendly. She recommended the spinach dish (sorry I forgot the name, but it's the fried spinach one) and we ordered on the second time. It was super good! It was crunchy and so flavorful. Highly recommend!"", 'Dear Stella,\nThank you for your wonderful review! We are thrilled you enjo our food!  \nThe appetizer with the spinach is called Palak Chaat and it is the most requested item on our menu!\nAlso thank you for posting so many flattering photos of our dishes\nWe look forward to serving you or delivering to you again soon!', ""Love this place!! As a vegan it's very important when restaurant label items vegan because a lot of places sneak milk or even chicken stock in a lot of items. I've made it a habit to only order from places that have the label which definitely limits my options, but thankfully Jalsa is so incredible that as soon as I finish eating there I immediately think about ordering it again. GET THE PALAK CHAAT!!!"", ""First time ordering from this place and I love it!!! The food here is absolutely delicious. You have to try the Palau Chaat, it's this fried spinach with other things that I dont know but is so delicious. We also ordered chicken tikka masala which was very creamy and flavorful. The customer service here was really good as well. They forgot our lamb Vandaloo so I called. They were extremely apologetic and quickly drove over  with the missing order along with complimentary Naan and mango Lassi. They didn't have to do that but am very grateful for that. Glad to know good customer service still exists. Will definitely order from here again!"", ""Lives up to the hype! So glad we came here tonight.\nWe recommend the palak chaat as a starter for the group. They really prepare the individual spinach leaves, so it takes a while. Worth the wait! It's like a delicious crispy salad that's somewhere between fresh and fried. It can be vegan on request. The dahi puri is also great. You can probably split that between two people, so each person gets one piece. Pop it whole into your mouth and enjoy the flavor explosion!\nFor mains, we like the daal with rice (rice is $3 extra). It's mild, but they have a spicy coriander sauce if you're looking for more flavor. Caution: the yellow rice is not vegetarian.\nExcellent friendly service, reasonable prices, pay cash or card, and gender neutral restroom.""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jalsa-grill-and-gravy-brooklyn-7?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Delicious, authentic Thai food and great service. It's also one of the few restaurants nearby that stayed open (for delivery and carryout) from day one of the pandemic, which was infinitely appreciated by me. Their delivery always comes so quickly to my place.\n\nWhile they do have some of the typical dishes that you'll see at every Thai restaurant, the true stars of the show are their specialty dishes, which are the authentic dishes you might have never heard of. Pre-pandemic, I've dined there and tried a variety and they're fantastic. Admittedly, I have a weakness for their duck curry as well the Pad Thai Boran (NOT the regular one), which cooks the noodles in an omelet and comes with a bunch of toppings to customize spiciness. So good."", 'My girlfriend hates me because all I ever want to get is Boran. Everything is great. But their food is much better in the restaurant than as take out. For whatever reason they change the dishes', 'Yummy Thai food!\nThe delivery was quick and the portion was bigger than other Thai places', ""Not bad at all! Can't call it authentic but certainly above average Thai place in BK! And price is very reasonable especially compared to Manhattan where I live.\n\nWe came here Friday night for Rosh Hashanah (bae is Jewish). Well, in that general direction :p - apple dipped in honey (brought our own), wine and whole fish (steamed stripebass with spicy lemon sauce). For balance diet, we also got veggie green curry, crispy mushrooms salad (love gingery!). All flavorful and perfumed with lemongrass and spice.\n\nIt was also nice that the tent blocked out some wind chill and the sight of traffic. Perfect for low key date.\n\nWill be back!"", ""Came here because of the amazing prices shown on Yelp, but when we got there, they gave us a different menu. Their eat in menu is way more expensive compared to take out even though there isn't much of a difference. Pad Thai for take out is about $12 but for eat in, its $16. The only difference is that the eat in price includes egg.\n\nFood is ok, not amazing. Portions are not as big as others say it is. We sat outside and we were sitting pretty close to the next table, way less than 6 feet. Most tables were not social distanced."", ""This is my second attempt for food here and today was a success. I ordered chicken pad Thai after seeing the pictures of it wrapped in egg and the site saying it will be the best pad Thai I've ever had..... ummm, ok. That would be a no. It was good and they paid attention to my request (online yelp ordering) for Thai spicy and extra peanut sauce. That part was perfect.... but not only was it not wrapped in egg I never saw any! I'd still order it again if I called to verify the egg questions.\nMasks required with service through a window. Outdoor dining available too."", ""Decent food, a couple items were a bit sweeter than they needed to be, a couple items weren't as piquant as I wished they were, but service is nice, the location is amazing, their outdoor seating is gorgeous, it's just that inside feels outdated even though they're fairly new."", ""WEAR A MASK! PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING! FLATTEN THE CURVE!!! DONATE PLASMA IF YOU'RE ANTIBODY POSITIVE. DON'T DRINK/INJECT BLEACH. SUPPORT #BLM PROTESTERS. SUPPORT MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES.\n\nBe warned that these guys get slammed on Saturday nights. My friends and I placed a phone order and were told 20-25 minutes, but when we stopped in, they told us it wasn't ready yet. Ended up being closer to 40 minutes with other folks lining up waiting for their orders too. But at least it was nice out. And we didn't *not* get a slice of pizza across the street while waiting...\n\nAnyway, it was worth it for authentic Thai. This isn't your run-of-the-mill Thai-but-really-Chinese restaurant. Sure, you can still get pad Thai, but then you're missing out on the good stuff.\n\nI went with the Nam Ngeaw (Chiang Mai style spicy pork noodles with pickled veg). Great flavors, nice and spicy. Ton of noodles and broth too. Packaged separately so the noodles maintained their integrity. The pickled vegetables were also separate so if you can control how much sour you want.\n\nAlso got the fried crab dumplings, which were delicious. Came with a bunch too!\n\nOverall, a pretty satisfying meal and I'd gladly order again!"", 'Great service and food. We got the Issan Classic, which was so good. It comes with papaya salad, roast chicken, spicy pork and sticky rice. Everything was delicious and well portioned. The pad Thai was flavorful and nicely presented. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes. Seems very authentic.', 'Very cute place\nWe came here for lunch,  they have lunch special for about $10, and it come with appetizer\nWe also order their appetizer platter, which amazing.\nEach kind come with 2 pieces so perfect of  2 of us to share.

Yelp will automatically forward your order (without telling you) to the wrong Luigi's (pizza is whatevs). You have to call the actual pizzeria, they have their own delivery people - mostly family. I made this mistake. I would have just thought the pizza was sub par if it hadn't been delivered with the cheese all slid off.  When I called the actual pizzeria to ask them for an exchange, I found out they hadn't ever received an order or delivered anything to me.\n\nThe original (this one) Luigi's shared with me the trouble this has been causing their small fam business. Delivery cut by 75% and even though they have sent numerous legal letters to YELP, no one is fixing this (YELP has a partnership with grubhub and the other pizzeria is signed up with grubhub) . Wack! Grubhub charges the business (and us) a pretty penny so Luigi's decided to stay independent.\n\nNeedless to say the ORIGINAL Luigi's delivered me a new pie that was INCREDIBLE, of course - cause their pizza is the bomb diggity, consistently. That's why they have been around 50 years.  May they be around at least another 50! Support the Original Luigi's!\n\nNo one paid me for this review nor do I know the Original Luigi's in a personal way.  Just a person with no special interests other than to spare you some subpar pizza when you could have this and support a NY gem."", ""Another great 2020 discovery for me! Who knew turning left instead of right when walking down 5th ave held so many wonders? Jokes on me for sure, I've passed this place several times and never thought twice but it turns out it's easily the best pizza in all surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods.\n\nThis is what I call a classic New York slice, the likes of which I grew up on and could return to eat every single night without complaint. A perfect thin crust with a solid crunch, outstanding sauce, great cheese and the perfect ratio of all of the above. I've walked in and ordered a pie a handful of times in the last month and even when I carry it back for 20 minutes and eat it semi-cold it's still just as good. And yes, this pizza is that good that I have leveled up my arm strength in carrying a hot, wide box forward and level while walking up hill for 20 minutes.\n\nFeel dumb it took a pandemic to turn my attention towards it but so glad I found Luigi's. Really appreciate you guys being open throughout."", 'Incredible slices. Old New York vibes. Friendly staff. Nice outdoor seating set up for Covid times. Will always highly recommend this place', ""First time trying the pizza here and am glad to have found a local spot for a slice (or a few) when hunger strikes :)\nWe got the grandma pie and fresh mozzarella pie and they were both tasty. The fresh mozzarella pie was great - the crust is super thin and crisp, the sauce is flavorful and with plenty of cheese. The grandma pie was good too - the sauce is incredibly tasty and we couldn't get enough of it. Only negative is that the crust was hard- not sure if the crust hardened a little on the way to getting delivered; will definitely try a fresh slice at the store before a final verdict.\nBoth pies had a very tasty green sauce drizzle\n\nThey're a small joint and don't deliver via any of the apps..you've to call them and place the order (don't confuse them for a different Luigi's on seamless). Also, they're cash only for both pickup and delivery."", ""After a brief slump, I found one pizza joint that made one great slice, with a very nice owner to boot. It might not be Joe's, nor have the reputation that some of the other Goliath pizza joints in the city have, like Di Fara, but this is one of the best kept secrets in the city, and I for one intend to keep it that way.\n\nThe owner is a perfect embodiment of New York City. A bit gruff and frayed around the edges, with a hint of that New York exterior that makes people afraid of New Yorkers. But inside he is extremely generous and friendly, to the point I could probably talk to him for hours, if he were not running a pizzeria.\n\nI asked him after I ordered my plain slice for his fresh mozzarella slice, but also asked him what he preferred. He, as a Sicilian, preferred the square slice. To prove it, he took one and heated it up. Then he halved it and he ate one half and gave me the second half as a sample. It tasted pretty good! Nice depth of flavor in sauce and cheese. It certainly would have been a nice slice if I got it.\n\nBut instead I stuck with my original plan. I am happy that I did, because the plain slice was great! Nice crispy to chewy crust, nice flop on the end, and good oregano flavor too. The cheese is a bit light, so is the sauce, but it is manageable. It is a solid slice for the price.\n\nThe fresh mozzarella slice is a great specialty slice. Great application of the fresh mozzarella cheese, good crust, good sauce, just an all around nice slice.\n\nI also liked that after he took the slices out of the oven, he folded each slice to show its foldability. This is the first pizzeria I have seen anybody do that!\n\nProps to this pizza joint. It is like walking into a snapshot of New York 40 years ago. The brightly lit sign, the 1970's-esque interior, the gritty New York personality, and a pizza slice to back it up make for a combination of a pizzeria that is definitely worth trying.\n\nBut please do not tell everybody, okay?"", ""Quintessential NY style pizza at it's finest. The pizza is made with a tangy blend of grated Parmesan cheese and good low moisture mozzarella, and it's never greasy to sloppy. The crust is fantastic, it's thin and crispy but also a bit airy as well. Nice amount of oregano present on the pizza and just enough of it. One of the better pizzas in all of the city, simple, but it surely stands out among all the generic stuff around the city."", ""I love this place so much that it is in our delivery rotation! We always get the same - large pie with mushrooms and meatballs and large grandma pie! For $43.75 - what a deal ?!? The pizzas are super authentic and I am in love with their crusts, especially the crust on the grandma pie!! Don't forget to tip the driver:)\n\nThe delivery guy is super amazing and so friendly - Always have a smile on his face!"", ""Classic Brooklyn Pizza. We had 2 margarita pies and you can't beat that thin crust baked just right. I wish my group had the appetite for another pie."", ""Called ahead for our pizza. It wasn't ready by the time we arrived but we weren't upset about it at all. It could've also be because we ordered two more things when we got there. All the workers were super friendly and we all chatted up a storm while waiting for our orders which were: a large pie, ham & cheese calzone, and an eggplant roll.\n\nThe store was kind of small; walkway was quite narrow, could probably fit 2 people at most. What was cool was you were able to watch them make your food to order in an open area. There was also a TV near the entrance for customers to watch if they weren't watching their food to be created lol. I also thought their vintage cash register was really cool too.\n\nWe thought the food was really goood, the best side of the pizza was the mushroom and meatball and the thin crust was nice and crispy! The calzone was yummy as it contained ricotta cheese with ham. I'm not a big fan of ham but it was good with the ricotta. We were disappointed the roll was really doughy, it could've been because it got moist inside the bag :( other than that, the eggplant was still yummy!"", 'This place serves up your classic NY slice.

Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with Steakum, I grew up on it. But now that I am older I can appreciate a better cut of meat for certain! Fedoroff\'s is grab-and-go so don\'t expect to be sitting down eating a full on meal somewhere (Even before CoVid). But nonetheless the steak is juicy, the onions are crisp, the cheese is cheesy and the bread is delicious. Overall this is truly a solid sandwich. I also get the plain fries, in my opinion the loaded fries with the cheesesteak is just too much. The loaded fries (which also has steak) are great but it\'s really a meal in itself if you ask me. I definitely recommend grabbing a sandwich at Fedoroff\'s, they give really Philly cheesesteaks a run for their money!', 'I\'ve read that the cheesesteak is great but when you are a business with Roast Pork in the name, I just had to try the namesake sandwich.\n\nThis may be a controversial opinion but I like mayo on my sandwiches: I\'ll sub oil for mayo in my Italian subs, I\'ll add mayo to my breakfast sandwiches, I even use mayo instead of ketchup when eating fries. It\'s my go-to condiment.\n\nHowever with Fedoroff\'s Roast Pork didn\'t need any mayo, the garlic and rosemary oil ""gravy"" was a perfect complement to a sandwich laden with tender sliced pork. I paired it with a side of fries which were the typical fast-food style.\n\nCheesesteak next time? Absolutely. Probably with mayo.', ""Definitely in the top 3 best cheesesteaks i've ever had!  Well-seasoned, just the right amount of cheese and onions. When they asked me if i wanted hot peppers though, i thought they'd include them in the sandwich, but instead they were on the side. ima need that heat IN the sandwich.\n\nTried the chicken cutlet Italian, but def could've avoided it. The cutlet was tough, a bit burnt, and dry. i needed to add hot sauce to make it manageable. The flavor with the provolone and broccoli rabe was good, but the cutlet itself was a struggle.\n\nFries were fries - nice, hot, and just enuff grease.\n\nWill def be back for that cheesesteak, though! Plus Tuesdays you get a medium size half-off, so all the more reason to treat yourself. Also saw that they've got a chicken cheesesteak and a Buffalo chicken hoagie. i might wild out and be back tomorrow!\n\n4/5 stars cuz ixnay on the chicken cutlet."", 'This is my go to cheesesteak spot.

Other than that minor detail this sandwich tastes as if it comes out of Reading Terminal Market', 'Best cheesesteak in nyc by far! I saw this place passing by it while on my way to beacons closet. Their sign advertised ""South Philly Italian Sandwiches"" and I have to admit I was like why doesn\'t it say hoagies or cheesesteaks being from Philly I was skeptical it would be that good but I\'m a sucker for my hometown so I got a cheesesteak with fried onions and provolone cheese. The cheesesteak was possibly the best I\'ve ever had in my life! A little pricy at 15$ for a medium size sandwich I would definitely get a large if you\'re hungry but this was lunch for me! I regret nothing the cheesesteak was amazing and worth every dollar definitely high quality. For the Philly natives living in nyc this is the spot to get a good cheesesteak!

We ordered the regular fries which are fried in pure lard and ordered a cheesesteak which had house-sliced steak, fried onions and whizz. The bread was very soft and fluffy.

But now, I've been living in Arizona for 4 months with my parents because of the pandemic (I normally live not too far from Barb's) and OH MY GOD DO I MISS GOOD PIZZA so a review here is now of the utmost necessity.\n\nFirst off, the place is super cute although it's often busy and can take a bit to get seated, so be prepared for that (at least, in normal times). It's good a dark and moody ambiance that's great for a date but also fun to just see a friend.\n\nFor apps, I like the white beans and pesto. I've ordered the garlic bread - just a heads up, I wouldn't get it if you're getting pizza. It's HUGE and when we actually got it before our pizza we were like wow ok we are literally stuffing ourselves with bread upon bread and this is maybe a little too much. So, garlic bread is great if you're just getting a salad and apps, but too much if you are getting pizza.\n\nFor pizza, I really like the Artichoke and Smoked Pancetta - I'm a big white pizza kind of gal and the toppings are all fabulously combined here. For a red pizza, I like their sopressata piccante. But truly, I don't think you could go wrong with a single pizza here and it's just a matter of what you like.\n\nAlso, the service is great.

It was ready in about 10 minutes. It was delicious, but a bit pricey ($16).\n\nNote: they do use basil on their margherita pizza, which is traditional. There are some brick oven spots out here serving cheese pizzas and calling them margherita. Lies!', ""The bulk of this review is for the service. This place uses a QR code to view the menu, order and pay in advance, including a tip. The waiters didn't introduce themselves or ask if we had any issues accessing the menu or any questions. All the waiters essentially did was bring our food and beverages. Nothing else. It was a very impersonal experience. Why would I tip in advance for this service? Very disappointing. As our items started to arrive we noticed a roach on the lattice wall. We alerted the waiters and they moved our table over. But the roach was still there and moving in our direction, as they only seated us one table over. We had to call the waiter again and specifically ask that it be killed/removed/sprayed.  \n\nFOOD\nThe pizza is delicious. It really is good. The dough is so flavorful. The burrata was creamy goodness. But please PLEASE approach the menu/ordering differently. The waiters need to speak and greet guests appropriately."", ""edit:\nAfter being too strict with my first review, I decided to change the perspective...\nthe truth is that even for a picky Italian like me, Barboncino pizza is really one of the best around.

The marinara sauce was flavorful and toppings were fresh which made every bite of the pizza enjoyable.

Prior to ordering anything, I made sure to inform the bartender I was allergic to pineapples, which he also made note of on my ticket! I first ordered the Casablanca then their steak & fries. I know their known for their pizzas but my stomach can only take a slice or two unfortunately. One thing I will note was that I had to ask what kind of steak was being used -- this was unusual to me but I guess no one has ever asked. After receiving the meal, eh I guess it really didn\'t make a difference as I ate more fries than anything & all the steak as well but it wasn\'t anything worth ordering again. Anyhow, a decent meal while listening to music and chit chatting with other patrons.\n\n($5) Hibiscus Margarita: Quite delicious although I wish it had a bit more of a kick.

We've made it an habit to check out new & exciting places regularly. That being said the Happy hour is elite, we sampled ever flavor of margs for $5/$6 which I believe the best one to be either guava or Mango, Don't debate me. Food wise we couldn't decide from the choices of pizza which were Interesting options but with speaking with the bartender he told us the most popular was the Oxtail Pizza so we went with that. I was very curious how the oxtail was going to be cooked because no 2 oxtails dishes the same. To my surprise the oxtail and pizza was phenomenal, oxtails was cooked almost perfect moist, juicy, flavorful (no bones A+++), you can taste the fresh cheese, and the crust on the pizza was also great with the perfect amount of charred flavor.

I've never had such a unique pizza in my life.

My usual pizza order from any restaurant is a plain pizza and I would dress it up with garlic powder, oregano seasoning, crushed red peppers and grated cheese. This pizza needed no help. Yummy as is. Only downside was that there wasn't any leftovers. The pie is small and thin. I think 2 slices are the equivalent of 1 regular slice at a regular pizza shop. Either way it was delicious.

True to its name, which translates to 'friend' in Haitian Creole, the space and food greet you like a good friend. The kind of debonnaire and cultured friend who hosts dinner parties, follows Bon Appetit recipes, and owns a fancy picnic carrying basket. I'm not projecting, you are.

I'm told they've opened for outdoor dining and can open indoors at half capacity in a couple of weeks.\n\nAll the food held up well through takeout. The shining star of my 5 star meal was undoubtedly the plantain submarine which comes with codfish and is cooked to perfection with sweet onions, which rendered the dish both savory and sweet. The plantain was the best carby vehicle for the cod, and the diced peppers acted as a delicious relish to top it all off. It paired really well with the black mushroom rice, which had a very nice depth of flavor.\n\nI stole a few waffle fries which came with my partner's Milo sandwich and something about the zesty and salty seasoning on the fries made them just about the best fries I've ever had. I wholeheartedly recommend supporting this gem of a restaurant. I bet they'll do a fantastic job creating a great ambience as restaurants reopen their dining rooms again."", ""I came back yesterday (7/9/20)and I'm glad I did. This is my second time eating from @zanminyc and boy these sandwiches were good. My boyfriend had the Milo sandwich which is a chicken creole sandwich. However, the stellar item was the Bali burger. Who would've thought to combine a turkey burger topped with herring. Mind blowing! It was explosions of flavors the saltiness of the herring balanced the juicy turkey burger. The fries were fried to perfection of crisp ones and the meals were very filling. Leftovers!!!  The greens were super delicious too especially coming from someone who doesn't like okra. This was the perfect food to bring along my picnic. They have outdoor dining now which seats 10 people.Can't wait for them to get their liquor license and see what creative drinks they will have.

For food we both ordered the goat one stewed and one fried. I loved the fried goat. The fried goat came with pikliz (pickled onions, bell peppers and cabbage ) which is usually poured over your Haitian food to give it an extra kick of spice. It also came with fried plantains. To us it was too crispy usually it is not as crispy. The chef they wanted to give it a more tostones feel. We just simply dipped the plantains in my goat gravy to help soften it. what a smart choice I made! The stewed goat was also and it was a great portion. I had it with a side of black rice. I would come back here again because of the friendly staff, food, and ambiance. Also, it was great to talk to you the chef he was very friendly and informative.

The food is usually good and the dishes are definitely Haitian-American, but taste good. A couple of things I\'ve notice on my many trips there.\n\nDisorganized:\nYou can make a reservation, but then when you arrive it\'s always a mystery about what happened to the reservation. And then, when you finally sit down and ask for wine glasses/chiller (they\'re BYOD with a cork fee), it can take you up to 20mns wait for you to get said glasses and chiller. This happened to us so many times, it\'s almost a joke now. It usually goes like this...You ask one person and they say they\'ve got it but then nope! Nothing.  You ask a second person and they say they\'ve got it, still nothing. You sit and wait and just watch waitstaff roam around doing other things. The managers/owners seem to have little care to this. This actually happened with one of them personally, where I asked for glasses and wine chiller. When I asked him a third time that\'s when he told me that they ran out of wine chillers. Ummm cool but you could have told me and also I see plenty of glasses though.\n\nFood / service:\nThe food usually arrives fairly quickly considering it\'s Haitian food. But on my recent trip I received a fish within a few minutes and the first thing I told my partner is that there\'s no way this fish is cooked. Well I was right!!  It was completely uncooked. This is a snapper mind you. They cook very quickly. So I tell our waitstaff and she profusely apologizes and tells me that she\'ll give me a new fish. Then she goes and I won\'t charge you for the second fish. Excuse me?\nWell what I received instead was the same fish that was clearly stuck in a broiler, which then made the fish extremely tough and dry. The fish was completely inedible. While I waited for the ""second"" fish, the manager was walking around and I tell him about the uncooked fish and I kid you not, he said oh yeah? It\'s the same chef so I idk what happened and just walks off. Umm okay.\n\nZanmi is a great neighborhood restaurant with good ambiance.

The menus, fitted between paint-splattered vinyl records, match the sweet array of tunes spinning from the speakers.

What a special place!"", 'Ix, pronounced ""eesh"", is the jaguar in Mayan zodiac. Upon entry, the tropical jungle theme hits you with its bamboo walls and a giant jaguar mural. The restaurant is cute with a coffee bar on your left and a dining area with little colorful trinkets from Guatemala. Even their BLUE tortillas are served warm inside a handmade purse!  And yes they have blue tortilla chips with the best black bean dip and hot sauce I\'ve ever graced my tongue with.\n\nForget the omelettes (they\'re great though), go for the soups!  I had the Pepian, which some consider to be THE national dish of Guatemala, made from Guatemalan chile peppers (gives it a smoky and meaty flavor) and thickened with pumpkin seed.  My bowl was filled with shredded chicken and large chunks of potatoes and carrots.  It\'s bursting with flavor and warms the soul.\n\nThe hot cacao drinks are pure cacao from Guatemala!  I\'ve tried both the original Ix and the lavender flavored one. I highly recommend going with the original!  Nothing beats pure cacao.\n\nService is also impeccable. Along with the decor, I really felt like I was transported away from Brooklyn and eating in someone\'s home far far away.', ""This charming eatery with a huge and colorful mural of a Jaguar and eclectic, Guatemalan menu is a sight for sore eyes [and hungry bellies]. Though they bill themselves as a Guatemalan eatery, their menu bends the rules with dishes like kimchi soup and a blue cheese omelette. As the NYT profile of the restaurant suggests, the chef brainstorms creative ingredient combinations in the middle of the night, and the flavors speak for themselves--this is fusion done right.\n\nEverything from the food to the cute vinyl record shaped menus suggests great care in small details which make for a nice dining experience at Ix. Of the dishes we ordered, the shrimp sliders were the tastiest. The shrimp was surprisingly plump, juicy, and tender, considering the low price point. The chimichurri sauce rounded it out nicely and paired deliciously with the ciabatta bread it came on.\n\nI'd love to have a bottle of that chili oil they have, which I'd guess is made in house. I'd douse every savory dish with that stuff if I could.\n\nHappy hour starts at 4, and their Michelada was really refreshing. Note to self to order Micheladas whenever I can."", 'Mayan, oh mayan, ix delixious!!\n\nIx ... Monty Python\'s Flying Circus\n\nDown at the southern end of the Franklin Avenue Shuttle there is a portal to the Mayan realm.

""eesh"" according to a neat-o article in the Grey Lady).\n\nThe inside of the place is like a Mayan rainforest (or at least a Mayan Rainforest Cafe™). We chose a cozy little two-seater in the corner. (It\'s considered, in these parts, especial bad form for a party of two to take up a four-person table or, Ix forbid, a six-person table! If you\'re a party of two, get a two-banger, please and thank you).\n\nThe menus are inside of old, broken, painted vinyl LPs.\n\nThere are tons of sections within the menu. One concerned omelettes, one concerned tortillas de huevo; one concerned desserts, one concerned unidentifiable botany of some sort and a creature that looked suspiciously like a dragon.\n\nWe each got omelettes. Dave got the blue cheese, pear + pecan crunch. I got the Honey goat cheese, fig, Modena balsamix reduction + macadamia crunch. And some lime alfajores for the table, please. Oh and an ix cacao w espresso shot for me, and some sort of fondue hot chocolate for Dave.\n\nAn alfajor, sing. of ""alfajores,"" is like honey and crunch and other sweet stuff. Its quondam abode is the Iberian peninsula, from whence it was imported to South Amerixa. However, before that, it was possiblye taken from the Arabian peninsula. Arabian. Iberian. Then to Mayan. The word alfajor possiblye comes from the Arabix al-fakher, meaning luxurious.\n\nThey surely were that. They were softish and lime-ish and delicious. A perfect sweet appetizer for our soon-to-come savory life-changers. (Results may vary).\n\nDave would like to highlight how thick the omelette was; it was like 7/16″ thick (whereas most omelettes are lucky to be 1/4″). They were also fluffy and perfectly round. The blue cheese was a game changer. A life changer. A world changer. A stranger danger.\n\nThe ingredients were perfectly proportioned and the eggs were perfectly cooked. We were given little soft tortilla shells, too, but tbh couldn\'t figure out exactly what they were for, and were too embarrassed to ask. So Bo put some of his side salad in one, and Dave used another to clean up some of the omelette goop from his plate.\n\nHow were the cocoa drinks you ask?\n\nYou\'ve got some nerve, buddy.\n\nMy ix with espresso shot (the regular drink is non-caffeinated) was one of the most sweet and delicious cocoa-flavored beverages I have ever, ever had ever ever. It\'s just like what I always imagined the cocoa to have tasted like in that book the Polar Express. Remember that book? Remember where they got cocoa on the train and it was like magic or something? I guess what we\'re trying to say is, that the ix with espresso cacao drink at Ix ix magixal. Literally. I have powers now.\n\nDave\'s drink tasted fine. But it was sort of goopy and soupy and fondue-oopy. Barely a liquid. Almost a non-Newtonian fluid. It was an acceptable beverage stand-in for the meal, but would have made a better portable-breakfast-on-the-go option.\n\nThe overall check was something like $40. A small prixe to pay for the best things you\'ll ever have.\n\nGo to Ix. You won\'t regret ix.\n\nWith 10 as a must-eat, this dining experience rates a 9.\n\nPro Tip: If any of y\'all go here, please find out what we were supposed to have done with our soft tortilla shells. That\'s the pro tip! And we, obvi, are not yet pros.\n\nPro Pro Tip: The water from the faucet in the bathroom is magma-level hot.

Maybe I've never noticed it because it's somewhat overshadowed by El Patron next door.

Sicilian or round pies only. No toppings allowed. Square is what they are known for, so that was the go-to! Yummy! Ordered over the phone, and didn't have my physical credit card, so the guy manually typed it in, when I picked it up a few minutes after ordering. There are separate outdoor lines separated by plexiglass. One line for pies and delivery guys, and one for slices only. I didn't attempt to go inside. I think it's closed for Covid, but not certain.

Really no competition.\n\nThey did a fantastic job reorganizing their outdoor lines to make it a streamline and efficient process during COVID. They do have outdoor seating but theres really no social distancing and the great people of Bensonhurst/Gravesend don't really believe in Corona and masks so you ain't catching me sitting there.\n\nTake 2 pies to go and call it a day!"", ""This place was always on my list to try and finally made it this weekend.\n\nFirst of all, the place busy...their ordering system was a bit weird, had to go to multiple windows to get a pizza and salad...\u200d\n\nI ordered the square pie ( which is what they are known for ).  It come in two sizes half a pie (12 slices and a full pie 24 slices).  The pie I ordered had sausage and pepperoni.\n\nThe toppings were 4.5 each...Now I love my pepperoni, but in this case it wasn't worth it.   The sauce on the pizza has a very strong flavor and drowns out the taste of the pepperoni.   The sausage on the other hand, comes in large pieces as shown in the picture.  \n\nSince this was takeout, with around a 30min drive, I take that into account.  They line there boxes so that was a major plus.\n\nThe pizza itself is very tasty, and doesn't feel heavy like from some other places.  Definitely deserves to be on the top 10 NYC pizza list.\n\nWill this pizza blow you away, I don't think so, but it's worth trying at least once.   On a positive note , we had leftovers, had it next day cold , and it tasted great..so another plus.\n\nOverall solid 4 star pizza place..."", 'Used to come here all the time.

Square slices of a fluffy, thick crust, topped with cheese and a tomato sauce that could shine on its own. It's hard to describe just how prime this pizza was on a chilly evening. Very satisfied!"", 'This pizzeria was on my ""must go to"" list when I knew I would be returning to New York. It is on everybody\'s list of best pizza in the city, let alone the country. And it did not disappoint. For the most part, anyway.\n\nThe plain slice here is solid, but nothing crazy. Not too crispy, plenty of chew, nice cheese and sauce combination to give it some extra panache. The pizza holds and folds well and tastes great. Nothing more spectacular than that.\n\nHowever, the main attraction here, their Sicilian slice, or ""square slice"" as they call it, is unbelievable. It tastes terrific, looks great, and has an even balance of texture and size. I got two of these slices, thinking that one would not be enough and that I was going to want to eat another one of these slices.\n\nI did.\n\nIn fact, I could eat a whole pie. The natural flavor of the sauce feels right with the cheese, and things feel so right after eating this slice.

Buy your slices at the window and grab a free table.\n\nEvery slice (square and regular, round) is $3. No toppings on individual slices. We tried only the Sicilian slices. Pretty small for $3. They were piping fresh, which was about the only thing that they had going for them. The dough was thick, the sauce was delicious, the cheese was nonexistent. We basically ate hot dough covered in tomato sauce. A pizza is supposed to have some cheese on it. Or any topping in addition to the sauce.

It was delicious with a subtle Nutella flavor that I liked.\n\nOnly issue was that the menu at the front where you order wasn't in English and didn't have the best descriptions so we had to keep asking the server what each one was. All the flavors were also covered so we couldn't see what they looked like to guess what they were. And since we felt rushed to order because of the huge line, the menu should have been clearer.

They have a lovely black and white photograph wallpaper which reminds me of old school New York restaurants.\n\nThe food- They do work with local farms and have a list on the wall. They also sell wine by the bottle and its relatively inexpensive, we got a sauv blanc which was about $20. What they do with the food is poetry though, the cheese souffle came with a cheese ice cream, the broth of the mussels was good enough to be from France and the pate comes with a small balloon of cotton candy on the side. I wasnt the biggest fan of the steak tartare, but it was soft and really well prepared, the clafutis tasted excellent, but was slightly on the stodgier side.\n\nThe wait staff was really good with us, made good recommendations and provided really great service.

They piled on the basil leaves, and although I didn't mind, my friend didn't like that at all. The fresh garlic seemed nonexistent because I certainly didn't taste it. I did really like the thin crust and how fresh and slightly chewy it was without being firm and scraping the roof of my mouth. I'm not really a crust person, but they nailed the dough here. The pizza was less saucy than I was hoping for, and some slices were very inconsistent, with the crust area starting halfway through the pizza slice.\n\nHistorically I haven't cared much about calzones, but theirs was phenomenal. We split a large one, which came with a dish of marinara sauce. It was a bit watery, but it still added a more refreshing tomato-y flavor without drawing focus from the deliciousness of the calzone. The dough had that same good flavor as the pizza crust, and the filling was perfectly cheesy with a creaminess that wasn't overwhelmingly rich. The ricotta really added an extra pop.\n\nLuigi's, one of my favorite pizzerias, is just a block away, so I can't justify spending my pizza calories here.

The Lemon Pasta, although flavorful was a bit bland. It was more of a lemon butter sauce and I expected more cheese to be integrated in the pasta dish but it wasn't.

The flavors were on point and ingredients fresh.  The one course I did not really care for, which our server warned us about, was the lobster brain - the consistency was quite gross for me. Other than that, the dishes were really unique and we enjoyed them all.', ""New favorite 2-star Michelin restaurant in NY (price point aside)!  Excellent sommelier and service; eclectic and beautiful artsy cuisine. Balanced gastronomy.  Wow'ed by the Langostine course (brains in its own broth, followed by perfectly grilled medium rare Tails) and the poached Hake (in its own bone-broth emulsion paired with seaweed/kelp and herbs). The quail course was the weakest link- too much sauce (could've done without) and the side was salty.  \n\nAll-in price (with wines) is on par with 3-star restaurants, but you leave with more room in your stomach and surprisingly no gift bag.  We celebrated my birthday and was disappointed the only addition to the meal was a candle- no complimentary toast or desserts/gifts like other top restaurants.  Overall, we loved the unique tasting menu but felt the evening was missing a few touches."", ""The Aska menu definitely felt experimental to me and my taste buds, and I usually boast about how I'm adventurous with food.\n\nI think this is my first time trying Scandinavian food, and unsurprisingly it's seafood heavy. My favorites were the Hake, Quail, and Potato Pancake. The Langoustine (lobster) brain was definitely an interesting course, and the tail was so good that I'm salivating just thinking about it. Because it was my friend's birthday, we were comped with mini donuts (I forget the name), which tasted very similar to corn bread and I miss them very much.\n\nThank you for a wonderful 2-star Michelin experience - it was definitely unforgettable."", 'Loved almost every single bite I had here. Other than gravlax and IKEA meatballs, I\'d never had Scandinavian cuisine before, so this was certainly an amazing introduction.\n\nOut of the tasting menu the courses that stick out most in my mind even a month later as I\'m writing this are the bladderwrack (laugh at the name but it\'s a delicious seaweed chip) and the lobster brain/claw/tail combination. But I could just as easily rave over the potato pancake, or the beer bread (the ""correct"" description is Manitoba loaves leavened with IPA, but let\'s be real, it\'s just beer bread) accompanied by butter and whipped pork lard, or the savoury af quail and black truffle dish. I loved it all! Even the ones that weren\'t my personal favourites - razor clams, osetra caviar and peas, hake - were still beautiful in both taste and presentation.\n\nMy table\'s least liked course by far was the blackberry tart that was the first dessert - there was something about it that straight up tasted rancid and bitter, and most of us couldn\'t finish our tarts, small as they already were. But the other two desserts were incredible - toasted hay ice cream with meadowsweet-filled aebleskiver, and a piece of bark with several candies on top. Probably the only time in my life I\'ll try something as interesting as their blood truffle.\n\nIf you come, I HIGHLY recommend the juice pairing! It\'s definitely unique - how many high-end juice pairings have you come across in your life? - and I couldn\'t pass up the chance. Our selection came with ones like Douglas fir, rhubarb soda with rose vinaigrette, huckleberry spruce, bronze fennel blossom, etc. I didn\'t like all of them but absolutely don\'t regret such a one-of-a-kind experience like that. If you opt for alcohol instead, don\'t sleep on their many choices of aquavit.\n\nService is impeccable, as to be expected. There\'s also a lovely garden in the back and a basement bar downstairs - the space is unexpectedly large. And don\'t worry if you don\'t catch or understand some of the waiters when they explain the courses - you\'ll get a take home menu at the end.\n\nI\'ll absolutely be back to try their winter menu!', 'KenScale: 9.0/10\n\nThe last time I visited Aska with my wife Jun (who was still my girlfriend then) a couple of years ago in the winter, there was snow blizzard on our way to the restaurant. We were heading over to Williamsburg from downtown Manhattan so obvious the ride wasn\'t quite pleasant, but I was very glad we ended up making the trip anyway as the meal that we shared was one of the best we had had together. In the quest (starting this year) to find restaurants that we would plan to go more than just once, I thought of Aska as one of the strong candidates. Of course, the tasting menu price at $265 per person (to be secured by $95 non-refundable deposit on Tock website) doesn\'t make the restaurant a place to visit every day, but if the menu changes on a seasonal basis, I figured it could be one of those places that Jun and I can go three to four times a year (just like I recently designated Atomix as one such place on the KenScale All Star list). I\'m happy to report that our second meal at Aska was just as memorable and I\'m ready to give the KenScale All Star badge to the restaurant.\n\nThe tasting menu at Aska has certainly gone up in price (last time I had the 10-course tasting at the restaurant, it was $145 per person), but it was clear that chef Fredrik Berselius\'s kitchen doesn\'t settle or play safe even after the restaurant has gained accolades left and right. The plating, starting from the opening bladderwrak with blue mussel emulsion, and ending with the petit fours of ""mignardises"", was just as thoughtful as last time, and the addition to flowers here and there greatly enhanced the visual appeal as well. If I wake up with a bite of potato cake with roe smoked in dried carrot tops and elderflower every morning, I will certainly start my day a much happier person. The razor clam with tiny slices of preserved black pine and cucumber was one fine piece of work, and the textural contrast between the caviar from Poland and the dried cabbage submerged in the sauce made from fermented asparagus juice was quite outstanding as well. You don\'t often see the tiny brain part of langoustine used in a restaurant, but that\'s what the kitchen sent out, alongside the tail and claw meat; Jun thought the brain was a little too buttery but I liked its rich flavor. Following another outstanding dish of grilled onion and scallop and the warm Manitoba bread accompanied by butter and whipped pork fat came my best dish of the night, a perfectly poached hake with sunchoke; I was astounded by the silky smooth texture of the fish that was melting in my mouth and contrasted very well with the sunchoke\'s texture. I don\'t usually get quail for a meat dish because it doesn\'t have the same satisfaction in texture that other types of poultry provide, but I had no compliant about the roasted bird (with a rather intimidating display of feet) with summer truffle. After the end of the savory dishes, the black currant tart with fresh cheese served as a nice palate cleanser before we moved to ice cream made from toasted hay and summer flowers that was quite a treat to end the meal.\n\nBecause getting a reservation at Aska requires the non-refundable deposit mentioned above and the restaurant is still quite popular among fine dining aficionados in the city, I would highly recommend advance planning to secure your table. There is full bar with rather esoteric list of wines (we really enjoyed a pinot noir from Oregon outside of the famed Willamette Valley that developed quite nicely in the air over the course of our meal) from lesser-known regions of the world. It was almost two and a half years ago that Jun and I had visited Aska, so we were greatly surprised by the greeting from our server who noted our previous visit; even chef Fredrik who we had taken photos together last time came by to say hi. I couldn\'t be sure if anyone working at the restaurant remembered us (even though we were probably the only people that still made it to the restaurant despite the horrible weather outside last time), but the extra gesture of hospitality certainly helped with my impression of Aska even more. As we headed out of the restaurant, Jun and I promised our server that we will be back sometime in November. And we certainly will.', 'KenScale: 9.0/10\n\nWhen I visited the original Aska at an unassuming dining space inside Williamsburg\'s Kinfolk Studio several years ago, I instantly knew I would love this restaurant. At that time, I had yet to get enough exposure to the taste of Scandinavian cuisine that stresses freshness of ingredients, clean flavor and minimalistic aesthetics, so the dining experience at Aska was certainly an revelation. When chef Fredrick Berselius decided to close shop about a couple of years ago, I was therefore devastated. Thankfully, chef Berselius promised to come back in a new location, but the new opening of Aska 2.0 has been delayed for a long time until it finally happened last summer. I\'ve been yearning to visit this new location in southern side of Williamsburg to see how it has evolved. On my recent Saturday visit, my girlfriend and I had to brave through the heavy snow, coming all the way from Manhattan. Was it worth all the trouble? Absolutely! I\'m so glad that Aska has come back, even better than its original form.\n\nOn my first visit, I was pleasantly surprised by the use of novel ingredients and techniques inspired by the nature of the Scandinavian region. Compared to the original location, I would say Aska 2.0 has matured tremendously and turned into an awesome dining destination in the city. Compared to the tasting menu that never passed $100 per person in the original location, the new Aska offers two pricier options (19-course option for $215 per person and 10-course option for $145 per person), but I wasn\'t complaining. If the first Aska was a nice introductory course to Scandinavian cuisine, the new location is an advanced graduate studies course, with so much more technical sophistication and boldness in experimentation. Every dish stands out on its own. Maine oyster was a nice start to the meal, and the next dish of grilled onion and Finnish caviar looked deceptive simple but so marvelous in the complexity of flavor that I was desperately scooping for the leftover caviar to make sure that I have it all. The ""lichen"" dish consisting of chanterelle mushroom and preserved pine shoots was another beauty, with rich, aromatic broth from mushroom seasoned with chanterelle vinegar that was simply wonderful. I\'ve had outstanding beef dishes last year, but I don\'t know if any of them can top the 120-day dry aged ribeye accompanied by preserved black currant and salted plum. The ribeye was more or less perfect in its juicy, tender state, and the seasoning was toned down just to my liking so that I can savor every single bite of this astounding piece of meat. Desserts certainly didn\'t lag behind either in terms of creativity of the kitchen. Fermented blueberries and milk sorbet made for a nice combination to clean my palate, but I can\'t stop thinking about the one that came after, a bowl of birchwood ice cream accompanied by caramelized pine mushrooms. The clean, delightful flavor of the dish was such a joy to savor that I would love to get a taste of it at least once every week. We finished our meal with two delicious bites of chocolate ""truffles"" inside a little bowl that looks like a bird nest and finally woke up from this blissful meal.\n\nAska requires advance reservations by purchasing tickets through Tock, so plan ahead and purchase these tickets. Unlike the casual vibe of Kinfolk Studio that is flowing with artists and local Brooklynite hipsters during daytime, the dining space at Aska 2.0 has seemed to matured as well, with minimalistic Scandinavian vibe with an air of tranquility and serenity that I found a lot to like, especially for a dinner date with my girlfriend. I didn\'t see any cocktail menus, but there are a lot of carefully sourced wine and beer selections (make sure to start your meal with a glass of aquavit, and Aska has a bunch of house aquavit selections too). I\'m glad that Aska has made this glorious comeback. Chef Berselius (who graciously agreed to take post-dinner photos with me and my girlfriend) really knows how to push the boundaries in his culinary vision that is inspired by nature of Scandinavia. I would love to come back soon!', ""Such a wonderful restaurant!\nIt was our anniversary and we wanted to have something special this day. So I've read a lot of comments and choose Aska.\nFood was amazing. We loved everything. Service also was nice. No complaints.\nI like the way they've presented every dish, it wasn't waiters. Cooks did it. And every time it was different person.\n\nThe only one thing I didn't like was cocktails. Not tasty at all.

During a random stroll, I came across the Lips storefront and I was immediately intrigued. About two weeks ago, I came in for the first time with a couple of friends and we decided to try it out for brunch. Two of us got the bake and saltfish, one friend got the jerk salmon salad, and we each had a different drink. My family is Trinidadian so I was skeptical about trying the bake and saltfish, but WOW was my mind blown. All of us had the same resounding comments about our food: well-seasoned, balanced, flavorful and just straight up delicious. I went back the very next day, and I would say I've visited *at least* 6 times in the past two weeks. I've tried the chai latte, which is so spicy and yummy. I've also tried the matcha (I usually add coconut flavor as well) and that, too, is delicious. The coffee is smooth and strong. They have many milk substitutes and a menu that boasts several wraps and sandwiches, as well as baked goods! I would include pics with this review but I usually devour everything before I even think about it.\n\nOverall, I have absolutely zero complaints about Lips Cafe. The decor, the drinks, and the food are all 10/10. An added bonus is how inviting and warm the staff is. It's always an enjoyable experience.

The menu features salads, wraps, panini's, hot food, breakfast items, and tons of amazing beverages. I love all the cold drinks including the spiced sorrel and all of the flavored lemonades. The salad is Bomb. It's not just a bowl of greens. It has a mango salsa along with crumbly cheese, nuts (if requested), and tons of yummy fresh fruits like grapes, strawberries, blueberries, and dried cranberries. I had the ham wrap with melty cheese. I also love the saltfish and bakes for breakfast. It's sooo good and comes with sliced avocado.  Yummm!\n\nI love supporting local.

The dough has a crispy, fluffy, slightly salty crust and thin center. The cheese is melted perfectly with the right amount of sauce that tastes like fresh crushed tomatoes. It's really good.\n\nThe meatballs... not ground beef, either chicken or turkey but juicy and very flavorful. They are lying on a bed of sauce and topped with a generous dollop of creme fresh, plus there is a slightly cheesy component. Make sure each bite has all the ingredients so you can taste some of the best Italian meatballs in Brooklyn.\n\nCalamari.. lightly breaded, flakey, tender and fresh.

Legit.\n\nSpaghetti, al dente yes.\n\nService could be a bit more passionate', ""We went here two consecutive Fridays because the happy hour is so good. So this review is happy hour only. I haven't tried anything not on the happy hour menu. Basically there are 3 pizzas, 3 apps, and 3 pastas half off. So that's 7-13 dollars instead of 14- 26 And thier house wine is 6 dollars a glass and it's pretty good. I like the house red a lot.\n\nThe atmoshoere is nice too. They put nice fall flowers on the table which sets the mood. Though a table for two can get pretty crowded with drinks, food and decorations on it. Also if there is a big party the night you go, like one night we went, it can get pretty loud in there. Also the bathrooms are a bit dirty and cramped.\n\nThe food is great fresh quality. And the food comes out quick from the kitchen. We loved everything especially the pasta. It is home made and the star of all the dishes we ordered. We had both the orecchiette and the truffle fettuccine pasta. The texture of the pasta was great and the flavors were very bold and delicious.\n\nThe apps are small in size. 2 meatballs and just about 6 pieces of calamari. The calamari was fried so well and so fresh and delicious but I only got 2 pieces since we were sharing with 3 people. At 7 dollars though I get it, calamari is usually 16 dollars for a whole plate at places. Also the calamari has some fried zucchini in it so even less squid!\n\nThe pizza dough is doughy and chewy and not crispy on the bottom. The margarita pizza lacks flavor. The pizza is nothing to rave about but for 10 dollars on happy hour its pretty good. The diavola pizza is the best and has the most flavor with the salami on it compared to the two others for happy hour.\n\nBesides the pasta being the star I also loved loved the olive oil that comes with the bread. I drench it in it. It has capers or peas or something in it and that makes it taste so good.\n\nAlso make sure you check your receipt. We had no problems the first time we went. But the second time they charged us 18 for the orecchiette pasta instead of 13. And they adjusted it though the waitress was a little rude about it.\n\nCan't beat happy hour prices. Best happy hour for food around (4-7 mon-fri). And get the pasta!!"", ""Came here to meet up with a bridal party I'm a part of to get to know one another. It was a good spot. They have a full bar and a nice dine in area.  The hostess seats you once most of your party arrives.

The only thing I can say about what I had is that it was a little more dente than I wanted, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The service was great.  Fast and the server was pretty knowledgeable when one of us wanted something that wasn't on the menu.

Their food, especially pasta, was excellent.  Great chew, you can tell it's house made, no faking a texture like that; I don't care how good your chef is.

Soon after, we were able to switch to a bigger table. While the menu said wait times might be longer on weekends for brunch, our food came out pretty quickly after we ordered.\n\nI LOVE the chicken and waffles here for brunch, it's the only thing I get on the menu.

The menu says demerara syrup, and I'm willing to bet it's a 2:1 ratio of water to sugar in that simple, because the Jim Beam did not come through at all. It tasted like a Werther's candy instead of a cocktail.\n\nThe watermelon mojito was refreshing in the way a glass of watermelon juice is refreshing. Which is to say it tasted like a glass of watermelon juice. Which is a compliment for watermelon juice, but not for a watermelon cocktail.\n\nI'm not asking for a straight shot, but the pattern I'm finding in Williamsburg bars is very... shall we say 'non-alcohol forward' cocktails.\n\nThe latte art and food items look great, so maybe give those a try.

The beers do me no wrong.

Pasta is Raginette.', ""We came across this place when looking up the top restaurants in Brooklyn and I'm so glad we came. The article mentioned it was perfect for a last minute dinner plans and boy it was. We sat in outside in the back patio which was decorated with sting lights and it felt very comfortable sitting out there. We started with a Burrata which was very different from others I've had in the past with eggplant and jalapenos. While it was different it was still tasty and would recommend this to those enjoy burrata. For dinner we shared 3 pasta which we ate all of (we were hungry and they were portioned perfectly). Agnolotti is a cheese ravioli with a balsamic drizzle (5 stars). The Gemilli Verde is a thicker pasta made from spinach which tasted great and was much lighter than expected. I would highly recommend trying one of these!"", ""Adorable back yard. Live music!\n\nOur whole party only had pasta so I'll comment on that. Tons of different pasta varieties in unique flavor profiles/styles. I was disappointed in the taste and it was a little too al dente for me but my party was overall happy.\nThe burrata was good while the charred broccoli appetizer was cold which I found bizarre."", ""Had a fantastic dinner with friends here on Sunday. Live music with great food & wine - perfect! My favorite highlights were the sunchokes, spaghetti, & the montepulciano wine. I'm not sure if the green olives in the lemon olive oil were complementary because I arrived late but that was such a great start to the meal. The lemon infused oil was so flavorful when you dip the bread! The duck ravioli was a bit rich to eat a lot but it was great as well. I would definitely come back.

I wish I had visited pre-covid! Seats are limited right now and they have outdoor dining. Our waitress was really nice and attentive even though she was the only one serving outside. We got our food pretty quick too!\n\nVeggie Banh mi ($9):\nSeasoned soy protein with pickle papaya mango garnish.\nWe thought they mistakenly gave us a pork banh mi when we first received the order. But to our surprise it was not real meat! It is made with soy protein and seasoned which made it look like pork. Honestly I think the soy protein alternative has more flavoring than real meat. Also we asked for spicy! There was a lot of jalapeño and chili pepper but we were able to handle the spice.\n\nLemongrass pork chop tacos ($9)\nThis order came with 2 mini tacos. The taco was packed with flavor -- like a pho in taco form. The taco shells are not same as corn or flour tortillas, as the shells are a fried savory crepe of rice batter. The shell is crispy and doesn't crack into little pieces when you bite into it.\n\nBraised short ribs vermicelli ($14)\nThis dish comes with shredded short rib with pineapple chili coulis on top of rice noodle. It is also served with the Viet fish sauce and side salad. The fish sauce just makes everything taste better. The dish is filling and super tasty!"", ""Very delicious Vietnamese food. Albeit not very traditional, it is very flavorful and memorable.\n\nI have been coming here before and now during quarantine. Their menu is simple with a few pho options, bahn mi options, and rice dishes. They also have tacos and some other things but i've only tried the first three that I mentioned.\n\nTheir pho is delicious! Their house special is a braised meat and super tender and juicy. This is where I say its not very traditional because they don't have any pho with tripe or tendon. Also I think the flavors cater more to the American palette aka a higher chance youll love it.\n\nIf you get their bahn mi, only go normal. Their spicy version is basically the same but with sriracha, so just omit that from your mind. And if youre doing a rice dish go for the luc lac! It translates to shaking beef and its my absolute favorite dish here. Cubes of juicy beef over rice and a salad. And for those who are new to Vietnamese food you pour the fish lime sauce over the whole dish and mix. YUM"", ""Ordered food through DoorDash and received my food pretty quick! The pho broth was still very hot and was able to cook the meat pretty well. Summer rolls tasted super fresh. Beef pho was tasty but pho at the restaurant always hits different than delivery pho.\nThe lemongrass porkchop always gets full points and never fails. I ate at 5ive Spice once before, but didn't post a review. I'm positive I'll eat here again."", ""Came here a couple days ago, it was the perfect weather for a hot bowl of pho.\nCame here around 1:30pm on a Sunday. There were a couple tables spread out around the outside of the restaurant. The table were spread out at a good distance. Party of two, we were seated right away, but shortly after us there were a little line for tables. So this place does get busy.\n\nService: there was a QR code on the table to scan for the menu. After looking at the menu, the waitress came by took our order. Wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Explained the menu when I had questions. After placing the food the first food item came out in about 5 or so minutes. The flow of the food was at a good time interval.\n\nFood: ordered the beer batter fish bahn xeo tacos. Those were really good. The fish was light and fluffy. There was not too much batter on the fish so you can actually taste and see the fish. I love the tops on the fish. The only small negative is the bahn xeo shell on the bottom gets a little soggy but didn't bother me because I gobble the whole taco up in matter of minutes. We also ordered the the 5ive Spice Pho which is also delicious. There is a hint of sweetness in the pho from the pineapple. The pho broth has a good balance of beef bone flavor. The last item we had was the bo luc lac shaking beef over rice. The beef was done to my liking. It was about medium/medium rare. It was juicy. You get to chose which starch you like it over. I think I would like to try it with the vermicelli noodle next time. The con I would say about the bo luc is maybe a touch more seasoning this is just my personal preference tho. I like strong favors.\n\nOverall I left satisfied and full. Would definitely come back. Heard they are opening a location in manhattan, can't wait as it would be closer to me."", ""5ive Spice is a small cozy Vietnamese place just south of the Barclay's Center. I've visited a handful of times pre-COVID and went recently to cure my pho fix. For COVID, they do have outdoor seating (I did not observe heaters) and mostly for tables of two. At 12:30-pm on a Sunday, there was a line of people waiting for seats and for their takeout orders, so I'm happy they are thriving right now. You hop inside to order (no indoor seating as of Sunday 11/15) and everyone is masked and orders are packed up well for contactless pickup. Note they are CASH ONLY.\n\nI ordered the beef pho and spring rolls. I've also had the wings and the chicken pho and the banh xeo tacos. Overall, the food is fresh, clean, and good quality. I find their broth is rich and has a tiny bit of sweetness too it, and isn't overly salty. The rice noodles are always perfectly chewy and never overcooked. Everything was well packed for takeout and broth was separated out from the noodles, bean sprouts, etc. Prices are fair, staff are really nice. Hope to see more of you soon!"", ""EATS: Dumplings, Rooster Wings, Brussel Sprouts, Vegetable pho\n\nI was a little disappointed, I had high hopes for this place. My favorite thing was the Brussel sprouts they had a sweet tangy asian apple cider vinegar flare to them which complimented well. The wings were cooked well but I wasn't too crazy about the seasoning tasted some curry which was unexpected and was a kinda salty. The dumplings were steamed and ok, the meat was seasoned well which I appreciate. The pho was pho wasn't bad just average to me."", 'I\'m an Orange County/SoCal bred Vietnamese so I\'m extra particular about my Vietnamese food. Finding good and authentic viet food in NYC is a real struggle since most are not owned by ""truly"" Vietnamese people.\n\nThe pho broth is really promising (better than any other Viet spots I\'ve had in NYC) but any dish that requires fish sauce can be skipped. The fish sauce dipping sauce lacks the authentic Vietnamese flavoring - their is more sour/lemon-y. But I give them kudos for expanding on the typical Vietnamese menu beyond pho to include Banh Xeo.\n\nIf you order the shaking beef (Com Bo Luc Lac), ask for salt and pepper on the side. This dish is traditionally served with a salt/pepper mix with a squeeze of lemon juice - not with fish sauce how they serve it.', 'I was craving Vietnamese food one day and discovered this neighborhood gem. We were seated right away and ordered the beef pho, classic banh mi, lemongrass pork chop tacos and iced vietnamese coffee. The food came out quick and prices were very reasonable for the area. The staff was friendly and food was delicious as well.\n\nThe noodles in the beef pho had a good texture and firmness to it. The soup was also excellent and packed with flavorful. The portion was generous and it was only $11. I was super impressed with the tacos. The outer shell consisted of a soft coconut rice crepe. I thought that these tacos were very unique and the pork chops were well marinated. The iced coffee was nice and strong but a tad too sweet.\n\nCash only!', 'Vegetarian Banh Mi - seasoned soy protein was extremely flavorful and delicious. I got medium spicy and I tell you i felt that kick for quite some time . If your spice tolerance is low-none get non spicy for sure. Baguette was soft and fresh. I like my veggies cold in a banh mi so I wish that could be different. Apart from that I just love when my sandwich is not bland and boring.\nThis is a quick cheap Vietnamese spot. I ordered for pickup but I saw they had outdoor dining. Gotta try their pho in winter. This is probably the best banh mi in Brooklyn!', ""Ordered again from here and got the Bubba again and got the Summer Roll again along with the Short Ribs Banh Mi and Beef Pho, but this time decided to try the Mango Salad - this was good, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nI also ordered their fish battered tacos and I thought they were amazing. The toppings and sauce paired with the fish exceptionally well.\n\nI am a fan of Banhmigos, but this place has better non-banh mi options than them, since sometimes you just don't want a sandwich!""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/5ive-spice-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Thankfully, my girl friend and I really did it up by coming to Zenkichi for after-work drinks and dinner.\n\nI had come here before and raved about it, but actually didn't remember the name, just the location. So when I passed by it again, I made it my mission to find the name and bookmark it on Yelp. I had to give it another try after all of those years.\n\nWe made a reservations since we didn't want to risk having to wait to begin our experience and I am happy we did. When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess in the cutest little dimly-lit zen garden, then immediately escorted upstairs to our super cozy booth. Privacy screen and all. We were social distancing before we knew social distancing was a thing. I'll note that the restaurant overall was in pristine condition - SUPER clean. I definitely appreciated this.\n\nWe each decided to do the Omakase (highly-recommend) which was not only picture-worthy, but also one of the most delicious meals I've ever had right here in Brooklyn. Every little dish was divine from our starters to our desserts.\n\nIn addition to the great food and ambiance, our waitress was super friendly and helpful. She explained every dish to us and was very conscious of my request for no sesame seeds (THANK YOU!). This was especially appreciated since I did not do the Omakase during my last meal here.\n\nOur meal was a bit pricey, but totally worth the splurge. I would 100% come back for another experience."", ""Very romantic on the pricey side but the food quality matches up to the price. I like the seating so that you don't see the couple or party seating beside you. They have lots of nooks and crannies for added romance. Which ever floor your seated brings an ambience. The third floor where I was seated you were able to see down to the bottom floor in this whimsical decoration. What to get?\n\n-zenkichi salad\n-seasonal tempura vegetables were ok not sure I would order again\n-potato balls - were really good would definitely order again.\n-edamame (standard edamame)\nThey have salmon it's just not on the menu two huge portions and really good. I didn't eat the lamb but my friend said it was good.\n\n-THE TOFU OMFG THE TOFU ALONE OR IN THE ZENKICHI SALAD IS SOOOOO GOOD. The best tofu I've ever had its home made and delicious. I can't recommend it enough. The chocolate pudding desert you have to save room for. It was delicious!!!!\n\nSapporo beer is the best.\n\nFor two people with tip and one drink was around 130.  Service is wonderful and they are very professional."", ""I brought my best friend here for her birthday and I must say what an experience. The owners of this place are trying very hard to sell you the full experience and we were so there for it!\n\nThe servers are extremely kind and very accommodating. They knew we had somewhere to be after dinner and tried their best to make sure we left on time. The food was very delicious. We've never had hot Omakase before and it was first for us. They even brought out dessert and wrote happy birthday as well! How sweet was that!\n\nBe prepared to spend $$$, but well worth everything that is happening."", 'I\'ve come here twice for my birthday dinner and it\'s delicious. I don\'t think there was anything that I\'ve had here that I didn\'t like. We made reservations for a table of 3 on Saturday evening and all ordered the omakase tasting menu. ALL delicious. We also decided to order the hot green tea since it was a chilly day in December.\n\nThe service is great--they have a calling button for the server when you need assistance, and they come and clear the table and bring out each dish in a timely manner.\n\nMy favorite courses were the sashimi (salmon, sea bream and yellowtail),  the homemade tofu was also quite delicious with caviar, and monkfish karage.\n\nThe staff was also nice enough to write ""happy birthday"" on the desserts that come with the tasting menu.\n\nIf you have the money to splurge for a nice occasion, would recommend coming here for the tasting menu course.', 'This is a place to be to celebrate a romantic anniversary. A little tricky to find the entrance and we had to call the restaurant to ask them for directions. Lol.\nTheir ambience literally takes you to Japan. Everything is so calming and zen, you just fall in love with this place instantly. You get a private booth of your own and they also have a call to the server. It was our first time trying Omakase with sake pairing and it did not disappoint us. Our server was really nice and explained us each of the plates that were on the table. A little overpriced but the experience is worth it!', 'Zenkichi feels like a hidey hole in Williamsburg. You have to climb up a series of stairs where the dining tables are in individual nooks with bamboo screens shielding you from roving eyes.\n\nI had the tasting menu here, which was a kaiseki style menu. Everything was beautifully plated, although I will say none of the food was especially delicious. The miso black cod is a classic dish, but the skin had a bit of a rubbery effect here. The tofu and red bean dessert at the end did steal the show though. I would recommend coming here for a date, the ambience is rather intimate and romantic.', 'What an experience. I mean, seriously, what an AMAZING experience. This is one of the restaurants that made my trip to NYC such a pleasure. Let me just start off by saying, the ambiance is just impeccable.\n\nThe restaurant is dark and romantic. You walk in and there is a sitting area, amidst shady candle lighting. Asian inspired, with rocky lantern lit look. Very Instagram picture worthy. The host grabs you, and take you to your table. Usually, depending on where you are located, you will climb a narrow set of stairs, very dark and kinda scary, but trust me it adds to the flavor of the restaurant. You are then taken to a small table, it is enclosed, and when you are seated they pull down and shade and VOILA you are in total privacy with your dining companion. The only time the shade is lifted is for service. You press a button when you need help.\n\nService is impeccable. So much attention is paid to detail.\n\nThe food itself is very deep, taste and flavor wise. You order in an a la carte style. It is not cheap but they have tasting menus, and waitresses are very helpful in describing what you may or may not care for.\n\nWarm saki was potent :)\n\nI would love to come back and share this experience with all of my friends and family one at a time. But first, I have to get back to NYC!', 'Seated at a cozy cubicle for two. Our waitress, who also served our food, had a pleasant smile which was nice being that we saw her more than eight different times during our meal.\n\nOrdered the Summer Omakase for two, an eight-course meal and a carafe of hot sake. The Omakase came in small dishes but don\'t let the small plating fool you... these add up! I was so full by the time we got our dessert I had a hard time finishing our black sesame mousse - total bummer bc it was so good. I\'m definitely doing another dinner out here for more of that.\n\nThe highlight of the Omakase for me was the Epicurean Shooter (literally a ""creamy"" shrimp that melts in your mouth) and the Grilled Saikyo Black Cod (perfectly cooked) but all dishes were great - summery - some form of fresh, zesty, sweet, crunchy and delightful. They did great creating this menu, especially for the price!', ""You'll find Zenkicki tucked away on the second floor up a dimly lit staircase. I must have walked by their front door a dozen times but never noticed it. I was lucky to have their tasting menu for my birthday dinner and really loved the food, service, and ambiance, The seating style is really fun and different because you have to walk through a maze of tables with a bamboo shade you can peek through to see your dining neighbors. We had a small booth in the back of the dining room and had fun seeing the dishes that were coming out to the tables around us.\nWe ordered the 8-course Omakase tasting menu and left really satisfied and impressed. My favorite was grilled sun beam and chocolate mousse. Though we're not big sake fans, we were able to enjoy Ichiran beers to go with our food. I think this will be a staple that we'll return to and we'll order a-la-carte to continue to try new items on the menu."", ""A multilevel den filled with bamboo curtain encased perfectly lit mahogany booths create the perfect ambiance for a romantic date at Zenkichi in Williamsburg. Couple that with a beautifully prepared 8-course Omakase Tasting Menu and it becomes quite clear why this Japanese eatery has been widely recognized as one of New York's most romantic restaurant.\n\nTheir menu is jam packed with umami goodness, subtle yet decipherable flavors and simple yet escalated bites. The staff is friendly yet accommodating and for the most part are unnoticeable which helps pave the way for a quiet and romantic meal.\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for a date night spot in Brooklyn.

So tasty.\n\nWe also grabbed some Chicken Parm because it's our go-to test at any pizza/italian joint. The sauce is so good! We didn't get it on a roll or with spaghetti, just straight up Chicken Parm and it was a great price for a big amount of food. They also gave us basically a loaf of warm, soft bread with it.\n\nAnd then.. (yes there is more stop judging us) we also grabbed the namesake Cheesesteak -- Lo Duca special Cheesesteak -- So much flavor, fresh. We have leftovers.. but they won't last long.\n\nI am a little concerned that I now know how good this place is. Thankfully, they don't stay open late when I am at my weakest, but I would happily suggest they stay open a little later because I would roll up in there every night."", ""I love, love, love this place! This family-owned business sits as a beacon of light in the community. They are so nice and the quality of the food is great. Prices are fair. I've had the wings, pepperoni slices, and other slices with other toppings including calamari (yum!). This is the go-to place for many people in the area, especially during the pandemic. You don't have to worry about the place being too packed because they deliver on the product at a decent rate of time. You're not there waiting all day. I hope they continue doing a good job."", 'Kudos for keeping up a great effort during a tough Pandemic!   We moved to this neighborhood during the heights of the restaurant closures and left some very good pizza places behind- Angelos ( real old school..) and San Remo on Cortelyou.  A month or 2 after reopening, we walked to Newkirk Plaza and gave this place a try.   This is a struggling time for pizza joints and the presentation of a dozen beautiful looking pies artfully laid out behind the glass counter fully awakened my appetite and we ordered several slices - Cheeseburger ( really??  ) and Margherita.   Of course, tough to beat reheated and crisp crust NYC pizza - I do think that is part of the secret success..- but really excellent slices that came served from the warm personality of one of the powerfully built owners.   I like Di Fara ( had one iffy experience there but some great slices other times) but for a terrific slice off the Q........this is an excellent option', 'This is phenomenal pizza!! I first heard of this pizzeria on my IG explore page and naturally I started following them. Today, I finally got to try the chicken broccoli Alfredo deep dish pie, honey sirracha chicken pie and a few slices of the cheesy garlic bread pizza...\nHoly cow the pizza was good,\n\nChicken broccoli Alfredo was sinfully delicious, tasty,soft , & buttery packed with lots of toppings\n\nGarlic bread cheese pizza so soooo good I wish they sold it as a pie\n\nThe chicken honey sirracha pie, had the spicy sweet flavor combination that I love..\nI highly recommend this place, I will definitely be back to order from them again', ""This place is awesome. Some of, if not, the BEST pizza I've ever had. They are a neighborhood staple and it's run by a family of Italian guys who's family have owned the place for a while now (I believe but could be wrong). They are all very friendly and kind. The upside down Sicilian pizza and the grandma are my favorites but I have enjoyed literally every other slice I've had.\n\nLove these guys, love their pizza, love the community!"", ""Lo Duca  hits different  it's one of the few old\nSchool pizza spots around. pizza is definitely above average and is always Consistently on point !!"", ""Pretty decent pizza the best in the Ditmas Park area and I tried them all .. we found out about it from a one bite review and they got a high score so we. Wanted to check it out and we weren't disappointed"", ""Like so many liminal spaces in New York, the pizzeria is a great equalizer. People of all backgrounds, personalities and socio-economic classes can rally around a good slice. I hold up Lo Duca as a prime example of a classic, true Brooklyn pizzeria.\n\nOn a Friday afternoon I found the place bumpin' with middle schoolers elbowing each other for a slice, people getting off from work, and retirees casually enjoying their midday meal. The guys behind the counter, who are the same guys who have worked here for the last decade move quickly, heating up slices, taking orders, collecting payment. Aside from the usual slices you'll find at any pizzeria, they have an excellent shrimp with a creamy sriracha vodka sauce slice that is to die for. Their sicilian is also solid.\n\nThe sauce is their strong point and is worth going out of your way for. The bread isn't the best pizza bread in my opinion, but that's totally up for debate. Nothing will get a Brooklynite to debate like a debate about where to get the best slice is."", ""It's so hard debating pizza with people especially in Brooklyn. No other place will have me walking two miles in the summer sun for a slice. Yes it's that good.\n\nThen you are welcomed with a cold blast of A/C and more likely a long line of people watching the pizza through the glass or staring up at the menu. Over 9 years no hippy decor just great pizza and great service.\n\nMargherita Monday (when I see a long week ahead) and White Pizza Friday with some spinach to act like I'm being healthy. The mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, and olive oil just float through the box to great you.  \n\nDon't be surprised if you see someone in the shade with an open box."", ""A true OG. What I love about this spot is that they stay true to their roots while also creating some really unique pies. I'll continue to support Lo Duca's and highly recommend to anyone who wants a great meal.""]",,[],https://www.yelp.com/biz/lo-duca-pizza-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Hands down the best octopus I've ever had in my whole entire life. it had a slight crispy exterior and super soft interior (almost creamy like raw squid or shrimp)... no chewiness detected. it had so much flavor that the dish wasn't at all overpowered by the chorizo (which usually has strong flavors itself). the chorizo was delicious too, and tasted of cumin (one of my fave spices!!) and the yucca was a great starchy balancer. the sauce was amazingly tomato-y (by now it's pretty obvious i love tomato based sauces) and cut through any excess grease. SOOO GOOD please get this dish!!! this alone makes the restaurant worth 5 stars.\n\n- Madame satã and tipsy lion cocktails. these were a couple of super unique cocktails. i definitely am a savory person, so don't love sweet cocktails, but these were way better than the average cocktail! the eucalyptus really shown through in the tipsy lion the madame satã had a but more tonic than rose water than I would have preferred, but I'm just a huge sucker for floral flavors.\n\n- Caipirinha do santo shots these were complimentary (thank you!!!) to celebrate the huge blue win this past weekend my bf mentioned he couldn't taste the alcohol in this one so that's always a good (and dangerous)"", ""Second time here and it was just as great as the first time!

They're on a corner so they had outdoor seating on both sides of the block. Great tent with hanging lights inside.\n\nLet's start with customer service. They were extremely great. Very friendly and attentive.\n\nFood was very good. The calamari was amazing. It had a good kick (little spicy) with just the right amount of grill flavor, on a bed of arugula and Meyer lemon marinated red onions. Delicious. The prosciutto di Parma was also great as well. Not amazing but still very good.\n\nOur pasta dishes were great too. I got the black spaghetti with shrimp. It had a nice red sauce with some kick to it. My fiancé got the black spaghetti with the blue crab. The sauce on that was really tasty. Great crab flavor but not too crabby. The spaghetti for both were also amazing - just the right texture.\n\nDessert takes the spotlight though. We were indecisive so what do we do? We got more than one. The tiramisu and panna cotta. Tiramisu was amazing. Light, fluffy and amazing flavor. The panna cotta was my favorite. I'm usually a tiramisu kind of guy - and it was really good - but something about the panna cotta with the raspberry jam on top just absolutely killed it.

The tiramisu and the cake pic...mmmm mmm goodness.

We've ordered from the TOGO location many times, but were less than impressed by our first time at the dining experience.  Management reached out privately, offered a genuine apology, and explained the reasons why.

The food is ordinarily quite good, and I'm glad they are receptive to feedback."", ""It either was an off-night, or this place is simply the ugly stepsister compared to their fantastic to-go location on Prospect Park Southwest.   The entrees took about 30-35 minutes to prepare.  The risotto and my entree were bland, and my wife's was okay.  Everything needed salt.  And the kicker is we've ordered these items from the other location.  I ordered the special - a fettuccine with seafood white wine garlic sauce. It had absolutely no garlic, too much black pepper, and tasted like rose not white wine, plus skimpy on seafood.  This chef was not sufficiently trained.  We told them that we were not pleased, and the staff knew we were unhappy how much longer it took to get our food vs other tables.  At that point, the super nice staff can comp my glass of wine as a show of good faith, but nope.  If you like this place, try their other location.

The scallop and crab meat soup dumplings were definitely very unique for sure.  I've had plenty of soup dumpling whereby the crab meat was a mere on topping on top of a pork meatball, but here that is not the case.  There is at least one bay scallop in each dumpling and evidence of crab meat was clear in each bite.  I'm not sure I dig the heightened seafood-ness but I can't say it wasn't unique.  I polished off a steamer tray of soup dumplings very quickly.\n\nThe chicken fried chow mein was a big noodle portion and also well executed.  There could have been more sliced chicken on the plate but there was no denying the crispy-ness of the noodles.  This dish was topped with gravy filled with plenty of carrots, broccoli, snow peas, baby corn, mushrooms and bamboo shoots.\n\nAs for the fried wontons, I think I enjoyed the sauce that was ladled on top more than the wontons themselves.  The wontons themselves weren't very crispy after it was drowned by the sauce.  This was another yet unique dish and definitely worth a try.\n\nFinally the last item I tried was the Five Spice Beef which was incredibly dry and was the least favorable item ordered.  \n\nThe food came out super fast after ordering and service was super friendly.

I wanted a side of mac and cheese but it wasn't ready and it was going to be about a 20 minute wait so i passed, LOL.\n\nMy food was delicious and hit the spot. It was enough for two servings which I love. The jerk chicken had a great balance of spiciness. The rice and peas were nicely cooked and not overcooked or stale.

We decided to come here because we were in the area and a friend recommended this spot based on their previous location. We dropped in at a slightly odd time so the place was quiet but immediately we got a warm welcome and extraordinarily friendly service.\n\nDebating between a few dishes, our waiter offered to do a combo plate so that we could try all the things that had caught our eye. We ended up getting jerk chicken with rice and beans on the side as well as a goat curry/oxtail plate with mac and cheese. All of it was fantastic. The oxtail was so tender and flavorful. Typically I don't like goat but it was beautifully done with a fantastic curry. The jerk chicken, however, is what really stood out. I think until dining here I had never had adequate jerk chicken in my life. It is a little like finding out the barbecue is a complicated, flavorful cooking process that can result in a masterpiece and not just smothering some sickly-sweet sauce on an overcooked pork chop.

Although I grew up in Brooklyn and went to school with a lot of people from the Carribean, I had only ever had the pot-luck style eats, so I decided to come here with my partner.\n\nWe were seated immediately on this quiet Saturday early evening, and the waitress was attentive and helpful. We wanted to try a bunch of things and she accommodated by giving us half-sizes of the goat curry and ox-tail and jerk chicken. We obviously got rice and peas and mac n' cheese on the side, as well as plantains and cod fritters to start.\n\nBoth starters were juicy and a good start to the meal. The fritters had a nice curry seasoning to them and did not feel heavy or oil-laden, while the plantains were just the right amount of sweet. I could not find any fault with the mains -- each was distinct and delicious in their own right. The jerk chicken? Spicy and flavourful. The goat curry? Just the right amount of gamey and saucey. The ox-tail? Stand out -- I don't even like ox-tail, but this was beyond my expectations.\n\nI don't know how they do it, but even the leftovers microwaved tasted amazing.

Met a friend for snacks and drinks here last night--we dined outside--and we had a lovely, safe time.\n\nBefore I detail how to have your best COVID time at Olea, it should be said that the staff, per usual, were excellent. Isabella, Ugene, and Flavio took care of us, made us laugh, and ran our hangout like a well-oiled machine. This meant my pal and I could have a proper chat and we were really grateful.\n\nHere\'s what to know:\n\n1. **Wait in front of the restaurant for the host to seat you.** I arrived 15 minutes before I was to meet my pal as I didn\'t know what getting a table would entail. Turns out, it\'s super easy!\n\n2. **Go on the early side of the evening.** We decided for a 5:30pm ""snacktail"". At that time only one of the other tables occupied, out of the 6 tables tucked into the three-sided outdoor dining shelter (more on this sweet set up towards the end of the review). By 6:45pm tables were filling up. Plan your time in ways that make you feel most comfortable.\n\n3. **Guests are invited to stay for 1.5 hrs max.** This makes sense as the joy of meeting up and eating/drinking together in a safe and cheerful environment has to be enjoyed in ways such that all who\'d like to take part, can. Timed seatings make this possible. Don\'t take it personally. Olea is just trying to help you, me, and everyone else have our best lives.\n\nBe prepared to eat as well as drink--meaning, you can\'t just order a drink for outside. Your beverage must be accompanied by food. That shouldn\'t be a problem as Olea\'s food is super tasty. (I\'ll share what we ate at the bottom of the review.)\n\n4. **Masks are worn at all times when interacting with staff.** For example, when being seated, when being watered, when ordering, when receiving orders, when being checked in upon. You get the drill. WEAR YOUR MASK unless you\'re eating/drinking. It\'s up to you to decide if you\'ll wear your mask as you\'re talking with your dining/drinking companion(s). No shame in #SAFETYGAME, friends.\n\n5. **Payment is done at the table with a mobile CC machine.** This means that unless you have to use the restroom, you can enjoy being outside the whole time.\n\nWe ordered cocktails--a couple of gin/soda/lemon/lime/no ice & the Myrtle Margarita, each. And for food we went with our old-time favorites-- crunchy chickpeas (with a side of Olea\'s stunning harissa & lemon); falafel artichoke hearts; bacon-wrapped dates; and patatas bravas. Ours was a ""comfort foods hang"" as we were discussing some life matters that needed a soft embrace. Believe me, discussing painful stuff is a bit easier with delicious tapas on hand. But honestly, order these tapas when you\'re on top of the world, too, because you deserve the very best, no matter your feels!\n\nFinally, let\'s get to the very cute way that Olea does Al Fresco, via their three-sided shelter and sidewalk dining set up! Olea is known for creating a warm, welcoming, and environment with lighting, plants, and a certain joie de vivre. Olea\'s outside dining is no exception. Each table in the shelter has a cozy and super effective hanging pendant heater. There are enormous and lush pants in between the socially distanced tables. And, shelter itself is perimetered with tiny lights and more plantings. Think hearty annuals that persevere through the frost, strung through with fairy lights--it\'s pretty magical and cheerful. Just the sort of vibes you need as a pick-me-up.\n\nThere are also a handful of outdoor tables arranged outside of the shelter, along the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Each of these tables have a columnar heating element, standing sentinel, at the ready to keep you toasty as you enjoy your evening.  \n\nListen, if you are going slightly bonkers isolating and miss socializing with people get yourself to Olea, in a group, on a date, or for a hang. And, Olea is still one of the sweetest spots to be a solo diner! However you end up there, please do remember that within the context of increased COVID safety hospitality protocols, all restaurants are operating with fewer tables. And that service staff are providing an essential service to you: taking care of you when you\'re not in your apartment.\n\nSo: eat, drink, be merry and TIP WELL--meaning, tip as you\'d like to be tipped :D. I promise you that it will be 1.5 hrs of your life well-spent.', 'Olea has never let me down. It\'s perfect for a quick drink moment or a leisurely meal moment and I\'ve been a customer since it opened so I\'ve had plenty of both. I remember the days they used to serve oysters with tears in my eyes because who doesn\'t need a priced-right, super fresh oyster happy hour just a few blocks from home? #Memories.\n\nSpeaking of happy hours, Olea\'s currently runs Monday-Thursday, 4p-6p. In days of yore it ran through Fridays and the hours were 4p-7p. It felt like a Brooklyn-version of Barcelona, guys: tons of tapas and tasty adult bevies that wouldn\'t break your wallet; neighborhood customers kitted out casually or in their Brooklyn-sexy design firm/art school/pr professional/author/film star/investment banker best. Sort of like Almovodar\'s ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"". But without the serious, mind-bending drug use. Or murder and metal wellness issues.  #Heydays\n\nFlash forward to now: although the happy hour tapas has gone up a dollar or two over the years, the menu is still affordable and the drinks\' price increase is equally modest. Guys, one can still get one\'s groove on here and make that mortgage payment, not to worry! It makes business sense to shorten happy hour traffic as extended hours put a dent in dinner margins because the entire restaurant gets taken over by happy hour folks who order up a storm and just chill through the night. I mean, I know you know but tapas (even hot tapas) is great at room temperature. Full disclosure: I often did this. Like order the entire happy hour menu for ""dinner"" and split it with old friends at one of Olea\'s indoor tables, or pretty outside cafe-style seating or newly made buds, at the bar.  #PersonalFinance\n\nWhilst the happy hour menu holds solid, I often eat from the daily ""specials"" menu. Here you will find seasonal offerings, some of which are farm-to-table like a pea shoot, minted-barley salad, with pancetta (or without, vegan and veg friends!) glistening with a delirium-inducing tahini (V) or yogurt-based dressing (VG). I often order the chicken empanadillas made with Goffre Farms chix thighs, eggplant and whatever hard cheese they\'re featuring that given day with harissa (from scratch!), even though the yogurt sauce this dish is served with is lovely. Sometimes they have Manilla clams in sherry for a special app. I get those, aways. Seriously: do it. Thank me quietly in your heart.  #411\n\nSummer time favs from the regular menu include their signature salad as it has every single summer vegetable grown in the State of New York. And when I\'m feeling sad, I\'ll get the 4-season-emotionally-appropriate orchiette with broccoli rapini, sausage and blistered tiny tomatoes.\n\nIf your shit has really hit the fan or maybe you closed a sick deal, I recommend their steak. For that ***red meat moment***. Rest assured that the kitchen understands what rare or medium rare means. BTW: fries lovers pay attention because the steak comes with an abundant quantity of beautifully rendered fries, sized in between shoestring and regular. I generally opt out and ask for arugula on the side because you guys, I\'m already stoking a future heart attack with that meat.  #Facts\n\nSometimes, one needs to go out in order to feel at home. Olea is the spot that will help you get there. I\'ll continue to go until I leave our glistening metropolis.  #Trust', ""Have come here for brunch prior to covid and have ordered dinner delivery since and I have both times been impressed with overall quality. Always a bit skeptical to order delivery at nicer places for fear that food won't last the trip the way it would served at the table. But my food came perfect and I couldn't have been happier. Can't wait to try more of their different tapas and plates."", ""We enjoyed our very first post COVID-19 al fresco restaurant meal at Olea for a late lunch on 6/26/20 and it was great! We preferred the red sangria to the white, but both were yummy and refreshing. We started with the delicious fried Brussel Sprouts and Spicy Feta Dip, which were perfect on a warm afternoon. And I really loved the bright herby flavors of my Summer Corn & Vegetable Salad.\n\nThey've done a great job of setting up tables along tree-lined Adelphi St. with potted plants around the perimeter, flowers on the tables, and fresh & clean brown paper table coverings.

The eggs are ""green"" because of the addition of herbs (think it was cilantro!) - thought it was great and pulled the whole dish together\n\nLocated in a super cute area in Fort Greene park - they have nice outdoor seating and great service. I\'ll be back!', ""The first time I tried to come here was a weekday and the wait was an hour and a half. So we tried again another day and showed up earlier at 5:30pm. We sat inside, right after indoor seating was opened up in the city. They also have outdoor seating, but it's always a wait with nice weather.\n\nWe ordered the Brussels sprouts appetizer, which was yummy, soft, and crunchy. Then we both ordered the orecchiette because we're unoriginal and it sounded good. It ended up being cooked well, but was pretty salty. I know the sausage is salty to begin with, but this clearly had a few extra unnecessary pinches of salt thrown in. Not the worst thing I've had but definitely could have been dialed down.\n\nThey took temps at the door and wore masks. Overall a fine dining experience. They do have an extensive menu, which is nice!"", ""This was a plan b dinner spot when our wait at Sofreh no longer seemed worthwhile - sometimes I just get the feeling that places with that much hype are never worth it.\n\nIn any case, dinner here worked out nicely - big fan of the Bavarian village vibe in the fall along the streets of Fort Greene. On to the food, we started with the roasted cremini mushrooms, which had a lovely smoky flavor and a variety of intriguing textures. The hummus was good, but I'd probably skip next time.\n\nMy favorites were the halloumi steak and lentil-pomegranate soup. The halloumi was not too tough (often a problem), and the romesco brought out all the right flavor points. The lentil soup is similar to Turkish mercimek, and the pomegranate syrup and crispy chickpeas really took this to the next level. I would come back here just for that amazing soup."", 'Wonderful place for modern Spanish tapas! We loved every one of the dishes we ordered - the absolute favorite being the Cremini Mushrooms with their superb balance of flavors and texture, tangy & sweet, l creamy & crunchy. Another stunner were the falafel crusted artichokes and I also highly enjoyed the fried olives with the fresh tzatzi underneath.\nService is superb with a great safety and hygiene concept including paper table cloth, wide spacing between tables and staff wearing protective equipment at all times. No reservations possible, but early on a Saturday eve we were seated within 10min', ""Great spot with outdoor seating on a street corner. Vegetarian and vegan options abound!\n\nWe got the Roasted Beet Skordalia ($7) with grilled pita to share. The dip was delicious though I've made beet dips at home before and it's not hard to make them good. I got the Whole-Grain Farro Pasta ($19) and it was a great mix of greens with pesto. It was light on cheese but I actually think it wasn't too heavy as a result. The garlic chips were the best part about it though, yumm! This dish is also veganizable although I didn't realize that til after I already ordered! I've gotten the vegan paella here before too and it was to die for!\n\nFor drinks, I got the apple cider with whisky & cinnamon ($12). It was so cozy and warm, not too sweet. Perfect for a chilly autumn night.\n\nCOVID times assessment: The seating situation on the sidewalk can get a bit cluttered especially if there are people standing around waiting for a spot. They do not take reservations so the crowd can get big. It'd be a better dining experience if you're able to snag a seat on their side street, away from the sidewalk. Everyone was wearing masks though. I hope they add some lighting to the tables for dinner time though because once the sun sets, it's really hard to see what food you're eating."", 'Excellent all day meal spot, serves the same menu all day but what a menu! Breakfast through dinner options. Love the lamb hash and the French toast (we asked for a side of ricotta and that really zinged it up). Coffee is excellent--not sour, rich flavor.

I found Chiko through Yelp and it was such a good suggestion (woohoo!). I came here for my birthday celebration with the bf and it was just mind blowing. We knew it was not your traditional omakase with just sushi pieces so we were fully prepped and excited for the meal hehe.\n\nOmakase list:\n- Foie-rrero\n\n- Hamachi (this was really good, I'd want another plate of this if I can - look at the photo!)\n\n- Robusuta (this was also mind blowing omg. The taste of the lobster with the truffle was UNBELIEVABLE)\n\n- Negitoro\n\n- Akami (duuuuuude - this was bomb af.

This is either my favorite or second favorite out of this entire omakase.  And this uni piece had caviar on it.. the flavors were just so unreal and exploded into my mouth. I can't even explain it.

I love it and would've ordered another one if I had room lol)\n\n- Hotate (yum)\n\n- Oh Toro (very interesting because I've never had olive in japanese cuisine and it surprisingly worked well).\n\n- Wow-gyu\n\n- Sichuan\n\nConclusion - 100% would come back when the menu changes. I feel like Chef Xiao is experimental with Japanese cuisine and infuses different methods into food. And most importantly - it works well (I mean duh. He wouldn't serve it if it didn't work well right? lmao)"", ""What an underrated omakase sushi restaurant tucked away in Greenpoint! All seats are counter seats, and the restaurant doesn't really seat more than 15 or so, so you'll definitely have a more intimate and quiet experience. The interior is modern yet minimal, and had a nice amount of sunset light streaming in through the front windows.\n\nThe starting bite was so good. It was shaped like a Ferrero Rocher, but was made of foie gras and chocolate. The rest of the pieces were really delicious too, and there was a good balance of creativity and fresh fish. The wagyu course was incredible, and I loved the selection of salts.\n\nI'd definitely come back here when they change up the menu!"", ""Such an amazing and talented chef!\nThe food was excellent with every fish dish. Well balanced. Distinctive, and the rice temperature was consistent, which if you're a big fan of sushi you'd know it's hard to achieve.\n\nAnd my god, the flavors, each bite the mix of flavors, rice, freshness of each fish piece was just amazingly well done. The chef told us most of the fish was dry-aged, to overcome the distance from Japan. You can't always expect a fresh catch from Japan or from the west coast all the time, so he worked with each type of fish to bring out its best amount of fat, taste and texture. The result is that each piece is full of flavor and still tastes so fresh and yummy. I also really appreciate that he uses what is locally available and that he tries to work with different fish, to bring out the best of each fish.\n\nMost sushi restaurants in NYC pride themselves in getting the freshest fish from Japan or somewhere else, and they never use the constraint of the distance to work for them and make the fish taste even better.\n\nCreative, freshness, special, distinctive, ... are the few words I can think to describe this sushi restaurant.\nTwelve courses plus a dessert was plentiful.\n\nThe only weak part of the entire menu is probably the dessert, they can definitely work on it. We had the Sichuan ice cream with chocolat piece and sea salt, but the ice cream does not taste spicy and the chocolate can be fresher as well.\n\nBut to find such a gem in Greenpoint is just a treat."", ""Always thoughtfully prepared and delicious menu. Truly something special going on here...!! Don't sleep on this place !!"", 'Good service and very good food. You can tell the chef really put a lot of thought into the flavor combinations and some of the plates I thought were quite unique. There were a few home runs and a few average pieces. The ambiance is a little austere and had too much empty space.\n\nWhy only 3 stars? Honestly, because we left very hungry. At this price point, it\'s not really forgivable to leave without being full. I would actually give 2 stars, but I really liked the chef and appreciate what he\'s trying to do; at the same time, I wouldn\'t recommend this place for that reason. Just one ""filler"" course of perhaps a rice or udon dish would have done it. Honestly, a bowl of fried rice would have helped. The pieces had very little shari which may have been partly why. As it was, my friend and I left hungry and fairly disappointed, so do what you will with this information!', ""This place is so unique. I've ordered twice with two totally different menus (they change the region of China each few weeks/months). They made a Szechuan steamed tofu vegetable dish really exciting, as well as various chicken and pork dishes I've had. You're guaranteed a good meal here"", 'Came here with my sushi lover friend but left kinda disappointed. I personally is a big fan of traditional omakase but my friend really likes creative style - we have been to more than 20 omakase places in NYC and this place is not the one we will come again.\nWalking into this place we got a very warm welcome. I like the decoration on the wall. The light here is very dim and the ambient music is somewhat ""Starbucks Jazz"" style... the first impression I had was that it didn\'t look like a Japanese restaurant - everything in the open area/kitchen you saw all the preparation equipments in metal/stainless steel. Only 6 people in the counter seats.\nThe first dish we had was the Foie-Reero, made with goose liver, walnut and chocolate. The piece itself tasted great but it\'s little odd to be served at the very beginning- it\'s like dessert and very heavy. Then we had a few ""fish in broth"" dishes which were very special and delicately prepared. The sushi nigiri was a big disappointment to us. I understand each place has own recipes on rice and flavor. But the rice here was falling apart- not tender not fluffy... and it tasted a bit too sour to me. I believe the fish itself was good but the flavor of soy and other ingredients and spice were too strong that mask the original freshness. Overall I feel it\'s a bit like mixture of several good ingredients but the outcome is special and odd.\nSo if u are a fan of traditional sushi omakase, I won\'t recommend u come here at all. But if you like modern creative style you might wanna give it a try and made some comparison to other places like Ishikawa...', ""I am very torn between giving this restaurant 3 or 4 stars. I want to support the chef's work, but I do not think it is a complete canvas the way it currently stands.\nHere is what was 4/5 stars:\n-The first few dishes were perfectly executed. My boyfriend and I were scraping the bottom of our small bowls for more broth.\n-The chef was amazingly personable and nice, he was the only employee there, chef and server.\n-The space is interesting, no more than 10 seats at the bar.\nHere is what was 2/3 stars:\n- Some of the flavor combinations were off. The Madai (strawberry), Hotate (corn), and Spicy (too spicy/not sweet for the only dessert) to call them out by name.\n-The quantity of food for the price. A little on the high side. Only one dessert option.\n-The dessert, unfortunately the ice cream was...icy (as in not mixed properly)\n- The sake and wine options were not ideal. We tried all the options by the glass and thought they were all very heavy and did not compliment the dishes well.""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chiko-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

A little bit hidden on a main street in Sunset Park, we initially walked right past it. Upon entering you're greeted with friendly faced bartenders ready to stir up a drink for you.\n\nI dabbled in a few cocktails - Bush's Folly (bourbon based) and Cielito Lindo (mezcal based) before switching to my go-to, Old Fashioneds. In between each cocktail, there was a round of tequila shots graciously comped by the owner who was happily taking them alongside us. At one point they even brought out popcorn, which we happily washed down with our delicious drinks.\n\nWhile we did not partake in any dancing here, there is a large dance floor in the back with rotating DJ's every weekend.

I could hardly imagine this to be the case just a few years ago, but my friends and I were spoiled for choice when looking for places to get cocktail within a ten block radius, so we bar hopped. We didn't know what to expect when we landed at L'Wren, but we were greeted with a hospitable staff who partied right along with us, a formidable list of delicious drinks, and a large dance room in the back.\n\nMy drinks were expertly made, with Bush's Folly being a standout. The elderflower brought out the ginger notes and the the bourbon was extra smooth. From the looks of different menu photos just over the last few months it seems like they iterate on the cocktail ingredients often, which I take as a sign of intention in their kitchen. At $11 bucks a pop, these cocktails are a steal in Brooklyn. I honestly wouldn't even blink if they cost 50% more.\n\nSince we had a long night of revelry ahead of us, we chased our drinks with multiple rounds of tequila shots, and the owner took some with us and even comped us a few. The dance room in the back was extra spacious and they bring in different local DJs every weekend. Comped shots, spacious dance floors and $11 craft cocktails are a rarity in this city but I find that you're rewarded when you venture off the beaten path."", ""L'Wren is a cute spot for drinks and small bites!

Very refreshing and not too heavy handed on the aperol. For the food, we split a number of small dishes. I'd recommend doing this as there are so many interesting, different Mediterranean dishes to try. DEFINITELY try the dips - every one was such a hit. We got the hummus, whipped ricotta, and the muhamarra. The muhamarra was the most interesting with spices and red pepper and pecans. For the entrees, we tried the malawich (a savory pancake with egg and tomato) and the merguez (ground lamb on top of hummus). I really liked both these dishes! The savory pancake served with the malawich was excellent.\n\nIn addition, the service was great and fast without being rushed.

Pre-Covid, if you were looking for somewhere to unwind with friends after a long day, this place is it. While we didn't have a reservation, the wait wasn't too bad and we sat in Fort Greene Park about a block away.\n\nOnce we got in, we ordered a few small plates for the table. The beet hummus, whipped ricotta, and a special -- spicy hummus with small cubes of watermelon and cheese on top. Hands down the best hummus I've ever had in my life (with the beet hummus being a close second.) It was the perfect blend of refreshing, filling, lightness, good karma and then some. I still rave about it to people. My friends who grew up abroad eating hummus on a regular basis aren't normally impressed with the fad of different flavors of hummus. They call it ruining a perfectly good dish -- but then I took them to Miss Ada's and they were completely blown away and now are Miss Ada converts.\n\nRecently got delivery again due to COVID, and was happy to have those memories of dining in flood back again -- same great service and food. I will continue to worship at the alter of Miss Ada. This stuff feeds your soul.\n\nP.S. they have an amazing cocktail list, too."", ""Miss Ada is a special place. Pre-COVID, mid-COVID -- whatever angle you want to take, Miss Ada looks like a queen. This spot had been on my list for quite some time before I finally visited. I live on the UWS and rarely venture to Brooklyn, which is the primary reason I didn't come here sooner. Though had I lived in the neighborhood without knowledge of the NYC restaurant scene, I probably wouldn't have given Miss Ada a second glance. It's unassuming and fairly bare bones. But the product and hospitality coming out this place is as excellent as you'll find in the whole city. If you like Mediterranean fare, coming here is a no-brainer. You'll find elevated Israeli classics that are true to their roots with an added layer of creativity. It has adapted beautifully to the new COVID reality and remains a powerhouse in the scene.\n\nCame to Miss Ada last Saturday night. We had an 8pm reservation, but weren't able to be seated until around 8:40. On some nights I'd be highly bothered, but the staff here made it all worth it. After we were waiting for about 10-15 minutes, the host brought us complimentary frozen drinks (a marg for the bf and a frosé for moi) as a gesture of appreciation for our patience. Another 15 or so minutes went by and as we were finishing up our first round, the host scurried back and informed us that our table would be ready very soon but that he'd happily bring us a second round, on them, if we'd like. We declined but thanked him graciously. Truthfully, since COVID began, I haven't been able to just stand around socially and chat with a drink in hand, so the experience was refreshing (we were on the sidewalk, Miss Ada is still fully outdoors for COVID).\n\nOnce we were finally led to our table, the host assured us that he would comp some small plates for us, which he did. They really do value customer satisfaction here and the place overall is just so warm and welcoming. Part of why I wanted to come to Miss Ada was the famed backyard garden, which is as quaint and romantic as advertised. The tables are maybe a tiny bit too close together but not nearly as bad as what I've seen elsewhere. The setup is thoughtful and makes for a great dining experience.\n\nWhile the frozen drinks were definitely the highlight cocktail-wise (though we also tried the lavender old-fashioned, which was yummy), the wine menu was also powerful in its own right. An emphasis on natural, biodynamic wines with a diverse selection of by-the-glass options. I've generally been hesitant to get into orange wines since my first few tastes in the past weren't to my liking, but I felt adventurous here and ordered a glass once our food started arriving. I was rewarded for my curiosity -- the wine was funky and earthy but not overpoweringly bold, just what I was in the mood for. Just take their advice here!\n\nNow onto the main event. Truly magical food. The menu here is huge (even by pre-COVID standards), so it's really quite a challenge to deliberate. Sharing is recommended, encouraged, essentially mandatory, and should you not want to share maybe just take your business elsewhere? Sorry, I don't mean that. You'd just be silly not to want to try to cover every last crevice of this menu. The dips and kebabs are the royalty but it's all fair game. They're known for their za'atar-crusted salmon and their brick chicken entrees as well, but my recommendation is skip the mains, go the the littles. I'd say we covered good ground. Eats, below:\n\nWhipped Ricotta w/ Brown Butter, Honey, Sage: A++\nThis is truly mind-blowing. I could forgo all dessert for the rest of my life and just eat this. Seriously heavenly, decadent perfection. Sweet, rich, creamy, all the good stuff.\n\nLamb Shawarma Hummus w Amba, Parsley: A++\nIt's clear why they're known for their dips here. Another unbelievable dish, served with pita but honestly you could easily just eat this straight. Rich, super flavorful and had me missing Israel.\n\nFalafel w/ Feta, Olives, Green Tahini: A++\nOkay, so speaking of Israel, the best falafel I've ever had was undoubtably there. But if you want my vote for the best *fancy* falafel, Miss Ada wins in a landslide. The perfect amount of crisp on the outside and the green tahini was just next-level tasty.\n\nSalmon Belly kebab w/ Labne, Charmoula: A\nWasn't quick enough to get a picture before we dug in but this was fantastic. Melt-in-your mouth good. One of the smaller skewers on the menu so ordering this could enable you to try more dishes.\n\nShort Rib w/ Red Cabbage, Israeli Mole: A+\nAnother perfectly seasoned, well-executed and varied dish. These kebabs are next-level and ideal for sharing. Great on their own, better in the mole."", ""If you have a taste for quality Mediterranean food this is the place to go\nThe service is great!!!\nThe drinks are amazing as well.

For drinks I had the ""Frose"" and a nice glass of red wine. The drinks were decadent and a perfect pairing with the food. We decided to skip entrees and order a bunch of small plates to share. We ordered the following:\n\nWhipped Ricotta: Delicious, creamy whipped blend.\nBabaganoush: Bursting with flavors.\nLamb Shawarma: Absolutely flavorful and well thought out.\nIsraeli Dumplings: A-mazing, the green sauce on top of it was to die for.\nAlbacore Tuna Skewer: This may have been my least favorite of everything because it was a tad bit on the dry side but the sauce it comes with makes it worth the while.\nKofta Kebab: The lamb was wrapped in a cinnamon stick. Ironically you do get a slight hint of cinnamon flavor as you bite into it.\n\nThe cherry on top was that the service was splendid. This place is really wonderful. I would highly suggest making a reservation as it visibly fills up quickly. Thank you Miss Ada!', ""Amazing food we got for takeout. I'd love to come back to dine in, but if not during covid, we will definitely be back for takeout or delivery soon.\n\nThe 3 for $25 deal is a great way to try multiple things. The whipped ricotta was my absolute favorite. The brown butter, honey, and sage were an amazing combo (I wish I could eat it every day). The babaganoush was just as good as all the other reviews say - highly recommend. The sweet potato humus wasn't a fav but it was good to try something different. These 3 small plates with the pita were enough to make two of us full for dinner!\n\nThe lamb shawarma was delicious and a pretty good portion size. The lamb was very tender and flavorful. The hanger steak entrée was hands down the best item we ordered. Cooked medium rare, it was so tender and even after our 15min walk home carrying the takeout, it was still so amazing. One of the best things we've eaten in a long time.\n\nAll servers were wearing masks from the outdoor dining we could see. Ordering online was very eaay and the website says how long orders should take before you order, and the order confirmation says the time to pick it up.

We also had the fall salad hummus ($13) which came with some fluffy pita. The squash, shiitake, and rosemary was a perfect earthy combo of toppings for the hummus. Next was the stracciatella ($16), a delicious, creamy chilled cheese soup with basil and tomato. The flavor was really delicate and light, probably my favorite dish of the meal. The shakshuka ($18) was probably the most underwhelming, too much cinnamon and slightly too salty. Also the meat eaters split the shawarma ($16) and the kofta kebab ($13) but I can't comment on that. They seemed to enjoy those a lot!\n\nService was super nice but made us order all our food at once.

I'm a fan."", ""Doesn't look like much when you walk past but I saw a video on Facebook of a sandwich with plantains as buns that went viral and went to the place to try it and was not impressed. I finally decided to come here late night and try their version. I got the yoyo which has sweet plantain fried as the bun with shredded beef. I think it was the best sandwich I've ever had. So many flavors just exploding with each bite. The plantain has something red on top not really sure what but there was a slight crunch and the beef has well seasoned and there was so much of it. The thing had to weight at least two pounds. I also got a Shredded Beef Empanada. My first bite was cheese and I thought they gave me the wrong one. I continued to eat it anyway and then the beef came. This was the best empanada I've ever had.\nI will def be back."", ""I was in the area and starving so I decided to check out Yelp to see what was highly rated nearby. Cachapas immediately caught my eye, specializing in Venezuelan cuisine. I ordered a couple of items including a shredded chicken yoyos (sweet plantain sandwich), mixed meat arepa, and a carne asada Venezuelan style burrito. Everything was delicious however the yoyos were the highlight. The combination of the sweetness from the plantain and the savory shredded chicken was perfect. The green onion and garlic sauce they have is literally crack and I had to add some to every bite. If you come here definitely try one of the yoyos as I've never seen this style of sandwich/arepa before. Service was also super friendly and the place seemed really clean despite the 'B' health rating. Highly recommended if you are in the area and looking for a Latin fix."", ""So I only had a 30 minute lunch window so I ordered early.

The delivery person didn't even have it in a hot cold bag he could have at least carried it in a hot cold bag so that when I received it it will be warm temperature what he did not. I took a chance and bit into the sandwich and nothing but nastiness. This is my first time ever ordering from this place and due to customer service and the manager supposedly not on Duty when summonsed to be spoken with. The sandwich was a rap there's no way in the world i or even a dog could have been happy with the\nSandwich. I was going to give it to a homeless person but then I felt badly and did not. Now the tres leche dessert was runny.\nIf you know about this desert you know this has to be a certain thickness to it firmness to it it's not supposed to be running out of the plate. I truly don't believe it left the store this way I believe the driver probably took his time getting here he definitely did not protect the items from the cold weather that we are having and experiencing today. He came to my location both bags blowing in the air changing the temperature of the sandwich I'm sure. so the sandwich is in there garbage as just as garbage is suppose to be. As far as the desert sure it should have been cool or chill but even IT  was in no condition to be served proudly. My first and last time at this restaurant you don't ever have to worry about me coming back for seconds it's not going to happen. NOT UNLESS THE MANAGER COOKS MY ORDER UP HOT AND SERVE IT HOT & FREE OF CHARGEI don't care how many people might have wrote good about this place maybe when seated at the restaurant if you can be seated there I don't know I've never been. I'm assuming if you're having your meal inside it maybe hot but to have it delivered forget about it, will never happen again. And to add insult to injury I called for the delivery guy to come back he was in less than three feet away from me and he kept on walking to his car. But I was still nice enough to give him a tip. I don't know maybe I'm just too nice of a person. I'm going to leave you with this if a manager does not want to accept the call from a customer or does not want to provide a customer with customer service about their product in this case about their food and how it was received then that is a manager who cannot manage a business properly.

It's not big and I have it for breakfast, but guess it's a great snack option too. Perfect grab and go meal. The baras taste slightly sweet, the chana is warm and savory, and the texture of both blends nicely when you take a bite. Have it spicy for an extra kick of flavors.

The flour wrappers were usually thick and stodgy, kind of stuck to my teeth.  Sometimes the fillings were nice, but usually the best part were the sauteed onions.  \n\nAfter living in Greenpoint for 6 months, I figured I should probably give pierogies another chance. For $11, I got a pierogi mix of saurkraut mushroom, and cheese / potato.  We also shared a cup of red borscht, and a meat croquette for $10.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the pierogies!! 6 large pieces, nicely boiled and topped in caramelized onions.  I loved everything about them - the wrapping was thin and not stodgy, and they put a lot of care into making sure the onions were caramelized rather than sauteed.  I made sure not to leave any behind!  My favorite was the saurkraut mushroom .. you can really taste the mushroom in the filling.  I was a bit worried that it would be canned mushrooms or something, but it was really tasty - I think maybe they used dried mushrooms, which had a pretty intense flavour.  I wasn't too sure what to expect from a Polish croquette, but it was a crepe wrapped around minced meat, rolled in bread crumb and deep fried (or baked)? I thought this was gonna be too greasy, but surprisingly, it was pretty light and not oily! While it was nice, I'd be curious to try the mushroom saurkraut one as I liked the flavours better.

The kielbasa was a very good version, not overly salty with great flavor.  The meat pierogies, made with pork shoulder were quite good.  The potato and cheese version were silky and creamy, topped with some caramelized onions and delicious.  The jalapeno were equally good with a nice spicy kick and topped with bacon.  The dill sour cream adds a little pizzazz to the pierogies.\n\nDinner at home was excellent and enjoyable thanks to Pierozek!"", ""I absolutely am obsessed with the variety of pierogi and how amazingly delicious every single one of them really is...don't tell grandma. The Ruskie is most common and what I grew up eating: potato and cheese with loads of sautéed onions and sour cream. Yum. Pierozek is as traditional as it gets. I usually don't enjoy that kapusta pierogi and yet these are beyond divine. I love the borscht with uszka stuffed with mushrooms and can often be found taking soup to go when I need a little self love because it reminds me of the food that fixed everything when I was a child. I never had sweet pierogi until coming to Pierozek and the sweet cream with raspberry is just simply amazing. I love how their soft and yet firm so they insides don't come bursting out. The owner pays so much attention to detail and ensures that all CDC recommended guidelines are strictly adhered to if you sit outside...while we still can. I literally drive from Nassau County at least one or twice a month just to bring these amazing pierogi. Also, try a shot of the raspberry vodka...it will warm you up perfectly while sitting outside!!!"", ""My grandmother was from Poland and I grew up eating authentic pierogi, and I can say that these are the real deal!

It looks great (as you can see from the pictures) and is full of seafood! Loved the variety of seafood and the crunchy texture of the rice. Great job! It reminded me of the paella I ate when I visited Granada.\n\n-Vegetable Paella: my bf is a Vegetarian and never had paella before for this reason. I'm so glad he could finally try this dish!

However the price seems to be consistent with other helpers of $32...so they should really just let ppl know the cost if breakfast since it\'s not changing and post it.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES did a story of their store a few years back stating the cost of breakfast is $15-17 which is on the pricier side but worth a try...but even with the inflation $32 is quite a hike and I cant get over the price lol. I craved japanese style breakfast and it\'s definitely on the fancier side than the food I ate on japan but I\'m used to spending $5 in japan ...for a 650% hike...any amount of fancy breakfast is too much...but I would encourage you to try it once.

There is a bar seating area with 4 seats and 2 booths on the side as you walk in"", 'Okonomi serves great Japanese breakfast at an expensive price tag. The place has 2 tables for 8 and counter for 4. The place is relatively small, and waiting in line is almost always required (no reservation). Our wait was around 30 minutes. Parking was easy to find on weekend noon.\n\nOkonomi serves the traditional Japanese breakfast with two add on options: ikura $6 and poached egg $2.5. The set itself is $32 with a selection between bluefish and swordfish grilled with miso paste. The set also came with a bowl of rice, miso soup, grilled eggplant, corn salad, marinated vege and beans with mustard paste. Although I liked the swordfish over the bluefish, both fish were extremely tender, you will not be disappointed by the flavor, gotta love that miso.\n\nWe also liked the tamago and eggplant. The tamago was very sweet. Overall the assortment was great seasonal selections.\n\nAt the price tag, we were very surprised about the portion, yes, very light. Everything was lightly seasoned and cooked, and the poached egg went extremely well with the rice. No doubt the quality of food lived up the standard, but the portion (or price) did not.\n\nNo tip required, service was great and on par. I would consider it a one time try, no need to return often. Came in with high expectation looking at all the great reviews, results came in lower.\n\nfood 3.5/5\nvalue 2/5\nambiance 4/5\nservice 3.5/5', ""3.5 stars. I think I echo a lot of reviews when I say Okonomi is good, but simply not worth the price they are charging.\n\nIf you want to try this place, come before it opens at 10am or else it'll be a long wait! There's only about 12 seats (two 4-tops, and a few counter seats) and they only seat complete parties.\n\nThey only have one prefix set for $32, but they allow you to choose the type of fish you get (I think this changes based on what they have). That day, I think we were given the choice of a salted mackerel, or a miso cod. Here's what it comes with:\n\nMiso Soup\nThere are soooo many ways they could have made this not a throwaway dish. Simplest way would have been just to add some ingredients in there that don't look like it came from a instant pack. For example, tofu, daikon, carrots, fish, clams, etc. This was really just plain miso soup...\n\nSmall bowl of purple rice\nGood, but really small :(\n\nFish + 5 mini side dishes\nI chose the salted fish, which I thought was pretty good until I tasted my husband's miso fish. SO MUCH MORE TENDER haha. But honestly both were good and were a great accompaniment to the rice. The side dishes were MINI for sure, smaller than what free banchan offers at a korean restaurant. Not sure why... we got a tamago, a small bunch of spinach, potato salad, pickled vegetables (that weren't really pickled enough), and I think eggplant. Looks like a super pretty plate, but it was just sooo little food.\n\nI know this is supposed to be traditional japanese breakfast, but I've had these in Japan, and they usually offer a lot more variety and amount (even in a hotel, which is usually more expensive!).\n\nYou can also add onsen egg for $2...! I didn't get this though.\n\nAgain, this place serves good food, but I wouldn't be able to justify coming here often at that price."", 'OKONOMI serves the perfect breakfast.\n\nThe rice is slightly nutty, every individual grain is cooked to chewy perfection, and the grains stick together just enough to be edible with chopsticks. The bowl is remarkably consistent throughout, with no overcooked or undercooked spots. Mix the onsen egg in for a slightly richer, creamy blend.\n\nThe rest of the breakfast consists of a slice of fish and a variety of little sides. Each side, from the sweet, light tamago to the greens with mayo and pepper, is a delightful little world of flavor. Both the striped bass and the mackerel are tender and flaky with a subtle marinade and crispy skin.', ""A bit overpriced but what do I know, I'm just a Japanese-American from Los Angeles so coming from both Los Angeles and many visits in Japan, this Japanese breakfast is a bit upscale. That being said...\n\nDelicious. Breakfast is served omakase style (set menu) and that day I had the choice between tuna or the oily fish, which I chose. I forgot the name of the fish but it was mighty delicious. Cooked so well. Rice was excellent, and all the side dishes were plentiful of flavor. Light yet filling. Very pleased with the meal, down to the plating."", ""The breakfast is phenomenal. Every side dish is perfectly seasoned and freshly made. We drive out to Brooklyn to eat here. Even the rice that it comes with is memorable. It's really one of the best restaurants for people who are very particular with authentic Japanese food."", ""Incredibly disappointed with my experience at Okonomi. Despite all the hype of this place, and the rarity of a Japanese styled breakfast in NYC, I thought the food was underwhelming at best. Went with a friend at 11am on a Sunday, and we were lucky to be immediately seated for brunch. There was no menu option since they only serve one item, albeit with two different types of fish - swordfish and bass. I got the swordfish and she got the bass. They charge a flat rate of $32 for breakfast tax non inclusive. Tip is not required at this restaurant FYI.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nI really like how compact yet spacious the design of the restaurant is! It probably at most seats 12 people, so it could get quite crowded. It has an open kitchen where you'd be able to see the chefs cook your meals in front of you. Opt for the bar seating, I'd personally like interacting with the chefs there!\n\nPROS:\nStaff was friendly and helped guide us through the menu. That probably was the only saving grace of my experiences here.\n\nCONS:\nWhere to start... first off the supposed star of the dish which is the swordfish. My swordfish was incredibly bland, like talk about a blander fish. There definitely wasn't enough seasoning on top, and the wish was wayyy overcooked. It was dry, stale, and once swordfish gets overcooked incredibly hard to chew and swallow.\n\nThe vegetables itself on the plate were sort of crunchy, and the pickled radishes tasted quite bland. There was a bit of salad on there, but I didn't touch it since I was quite disappointed with what I was presented on the plate.\n\nMiso soup was also weirdly tasting. It seemed a lot saltier than what I am used to in other Manhattan Japanese restaurants. Also, in their miso soup they had small diced bits of onions I reckon? That seemed a little off-putting to me when I drank their soup.\n\nTamago and the rice it came with was okay. Just nothing special or memorable from eating those.\n\nPortions were incredibly tiny, small, and underwhelming. For $32 dollars I'd expected something to blow me out of the world. Neither the food was good, nor was it filling. Definitely really disappointing. I thought with the quality of food and the portions we got it should be worth no more than $20.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'm keeping it two stars since I really liked the decor here and the staff were relatively friendly. But seriously, food was definitely lacking, price was a little outrageous for what we good, and flavors were incredibly bland. Definitely would not recommend anyone to try out their breakfast here.""]",,"['delivery', 'pickup']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/okonomi-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Really good gem of a place on Broadway.  We didn't have reservations but ordered with he friendly host and it took about 30 mins (while drinking a can of bubbly rose outside).  The pizza?  It rivals Robertas for sure.  Crust was perfectly cooked with a little char and a good balance of chewy.  Only complaint was there could have been more cheese on the margarita.  Staff was fantastic.  A++"", ""Pizza is delicious, the usual waitress also is great! Why not all stars?  EVERY SINGLE TIME we have had to wait in the 30 mins range to eat.. this is despite having a reservation. It seems that they don't stagger the reservations enough and you always have to wait a while."", 'Great spot.. hidden gem. The staff are attentive! The cocktails were tasty and the pizza was incredible... will definitely be back!', ""I've only gotten delivery, but their pizza is awesome! I've had the Napoli, Spec e Zola, Prosciutto e Funghi, Salame Piccante and the Santa Panza.\nI think the Zola was my favorite, really a unique pizza. My second favorite was the Santa Panza, the sauage was amazing. But all the pizza's I've had here are amazing! I really need to come and eat here in person soon. But as far as delivery goes this place it the best!!! Kudos"", ""This is a nice little Italian place with a back patio and bar. The pizza making happens right in the middle of the main dining area and the rest of the dishes are made in an open kitchen behind the bar. My husband and I have come here several times. I've never ordered drinks and without alcohol it's incredibly affordable for a dinner out. The real gems are the pizzas. They're delicious, somewhere between thin and thick crust, fresh toppings. I would compare the pizzas to a Roberta's style pizza for context. I've tried pasta on two visits and it made me long for the pizza my husband had across the table. Check it out, skip the pasta, get the pizza!"", 'Cool vibe in this spot. Love the pizza, wine, ambiance, service, crowd. All of it!!! My only issue was that they only take cash!!! It was late night and they were the closest restaurant in the area that was open. I was disappointed about the ""only cash"" situation, but made it work.', ""We have visited this little joint a couple of times. I had the Porchetta (large boneless pork chop) the first time and it was very salty and a bit dry. I would stick with the pizza which is excellent. We also love the burratta and meatballs. Cash only and the ATM didn't work the last time we were there. So be prepared. Decor is old world maps and I'm hoping they will replace the rusty metal folding chairs eventually. That's a little too rustic.""]",,"['delivery', 'pickup']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/santa-panza-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

All were really good except for the sweet potato. To me the roasting method dried out the potato too much ultimately destroying its desired texture when pairing with fish . Maybe with poultry it'll be better ?

He and his co-owner, Rob, are two of the nicest and most fun-loving dudes you\'ll ever meet. The two of them are ND grads, so they drink like Catholics and can also carry on a conversation about just about anything, from sports to politics to current events. They love interacting with their guests and are quick to learn a name (I had friends who would drop by like, twice, six months apart, and Brad would reference them by name like three months after that).\n\nThe goods: these guys know how to turn a profit (I\'m assuming?) but not charge you an arm and a leg. Everything is reasonably priced, they have a good beer/cider selection and all of your standard liquors. Best thing: you get a personal pizza with every drink. No, it\'s not, like, Ignazios, but it definitely hits the spot.\n\nThe ambiance is as divey as it gets, and they offer table games like jenga & connect4. The walls, ceiling, and bathrooms are all oozing with kitsch. It\'s fantastic.\n\nThe events: well, they\'re an ND bar, so they have a big projection screen for all ND football games and major basketball games. It can get fairly packed depending on how big the opponent is, and Brad has been known to parade around pouring Jameson into people\'s mouths if the Irish score a touchdown. Other than this debauchery, they have also had events like Karaoke Night and the ""Cheez Ball,"" which I have never attended but I believe is a big celebration of their opening anniversary every year.\n\nAll in all, this was my literal corner bar for 5 years and I\'m so sad I moved away from it.

I had a very hard time choosing what I wanted--all the empanadas sound amazing and have a unique twist to them that I've never seen anywhere else. I ended up ordering two: the Thanksgiving, which was filled with ground turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cranberry, and another one (that I forgot the name of) that was filled with ground beef and sweet plantains. They were both delicious! I especially loved the ground beef and sweet plantains, the mix of savory and sweet was perfect. It takes about 13 minutes for your empanadas to come out so order from Kim and then grab a drink at the bar while you let your anticipation (and your appetite) build.\n\nKim is friendly and sweet, she brought our order right out to us along with some different hot sauces, and even checked back in with us while we were eating to see how we liked everything!

I knew I would have a great experience as they deliver consistently great service, great food and the restaurant has a cozy vibe. Really generous portion size and everything has fresh ingredients. There is an open air feel with a garage style window goor that is left open when the weather is good. You can eat outside during the spring and summer and they have an awning that keeps out the the sun. Most times there is a nice breeze from the water and you have a great view of the Verrazano Bridge.\n\nWhat I like most is that even when you come to a restaurant and you have a different server than you are use to they are great. This shows the owners and managers care and train their staff properly. From the hostess to the runners to the the wait staff. One example is that as a main course we had Dover Sole. When I ordered it about 2 years ago the waitress who was about 22 was able to filet the fish like a champ. She did not have to call over a manager or chef. I had never experienced that in a restaurant of this type I would expect that at Daniel in Manhattan not here. Fast forward to my birthday and the waiter took care of filleting the sole like an old pro and he was only in his twenties.\n\nOur waiter Mak made the experience memorable and we felt like he served us many times before. The only thing was this was the first time we met. He made sure everything was great and I did not tell him it was my birthday until after we were all done.\n\nWe started with a Lobster roll special which was worth every penny. It came with warm chips and a cole slaw that had a great kick to it. We also had Nonna's meatballs which are pan fried in a tomato sauce. You get four and either appetizer was almost a meal in itself.\n\nFor the main course we had the Dover Sole which comes with vegetables. We also had the Sunday Special pasta which is a combination of meatballs, sausage and Pappardelle wide ribbon pasta that was absolutely phenomenal. It is topped with fresh ricotta cheese an the sauce was great as well.   I included photos of my left overs which was a meal in itself. When they serve the dish the aroma was to die for.  \n\nFor desert I had the Napoleon which I have had before. This is freshly made, has fresh strawberries and other fruits and probably not the typical one you think of from you local bakery. It is light, and refreshing. I highly recommend it.\n\nThey have a nice wine selection and I had a glass of the Pinot Noir. The also offer a raw bar, Veal, Chicken, Fish and salads. For lunch they have sandwiches as well. I don't give out too many 5 star reviews although I feel they have earned it from my experience over the last 7 or 8 visits. There is valet parking as parking can be a little tough in Bay Ridge. They also have a tv for all the important games that most tables have a good view of.\n\nPositano's is one of those places not just to be seen, it offers great food, service and prices that are in line for the quality of food they serve. I would highly recommend them for a great experience any time of the day."", ""Great staff here from the bussers to the manager.

Suggest taking a smaller group for walk ups and calling ahead for larger groups due to the COViD adjusted seating."", ""Positano is a very well known Italian Restaurant in Bay Ridge and it is always packed so if you're planning on going for dinner on the weekend you better make a reservation in advance to ensure that you have a seat. With all that hype we decided to go and try their food and omgggggggg!!! All that hype and the fact that is always packed makes total sense now! What a delicious dinner we had!\n\nLet's start with their outdoor dinning area, they have done a gorgeous job with decks, tables, plants and heaters that makes their corner space truly beautiful.\n\nWe started with some drinks, their mojito was really good and the red wine my husband had was delicious too. After wondering what to order from the menu (they have so many good dishes that was very difficult to choose one dish) we decided to listen to our server and order the special that came with MacnCheese, cream spinach, green spicy peppers (extremely spicy!! So careful on these and don't take a big bite on them) and a delicious porterhouse steak. They brought all the food in big plates and the server put the individual portions in front of us, just a beautiful show to watch seeing him working the stake and putting everything perfectly on our plates. The MacnCheese was just delicious, the truffle taste with the perfectly cooked pasta and the melting cheese just melted in your mouth leaving a delicious creaminess and truffle taste on your buds. The spinach was extremely soft and creamy as well and the taste was amazing! Finally, the steak was easily the best steak I have EVER had in my entire life!!! It was extremely tender, perfectly cooked and it just melted in your mouth, I have never experienced anything like that, definitely must try it! I don't have enough words to explain or describe how delicious that porterhouse steak really was. Even though we ended up rolling back home from how full we were, we definitely have to go back because we have to try their desserts. We ended so full that we couldn't order anything else, such a pity since they all looked delicious too!!"", ""All the way down at the very very end of Bay Ridge (so far that if you take a few more steps you're in Staten Island) is Positano's - well worth making the trip down.\n\nIncredibly popular before Covid-19, and all the more so now that there's less tables available, making a reservation is a must! The seating on the outdoor patio and sidewalk are a bit tight when it comes to the recommended 6 feet distance. However, the one thing that hasn't changed due to covid is the incredible food!\n\nAbsolutely incredible bread served with a eggplant and tomatoe sauce for the table starts the meal off great. For a main, I got spaghetti vongole, heaping with little neck clams every bite drenched in olive oil and cheese. As opposed to other restaurants where you get a handful of clams, some clenched shut, Positano gives almost two dozen jewels of the sea, all open and ready to enjoy. I also tasted a bite of the ribeye and glazed carrots, both delicious.\n\nThe service can be rather slow. Even with multiple waiters swarming the patio, it's hard to flag one down. Similarly, the time between ordering and getting served can take forever"", ""This place is the best Italian spot in Bay ridge. From the ambiance to the service to the decor to the food , everything is amazing.

The staff were attentive and kind. All wearing masks. Outdoor seating was very nice.

There is enough for 8 to 10 people at the bar. The restaurant is fairly long in length with fair amount of place to eat. They have booths for multiple patrons also. There were about 6 groups inside, not too crazy for a Friday night.\n\nOrdered a Japanese beer and some hot sake to make sake bombs to start with some fried oysters. It comes in a dipping sauce.  We downed 2 sake bombs to get our appetite going. They have a huge menu divided into many groups; fish, chicken, pork, beef, vegetable, rice, etc. We went for the shrimp dumplings and it also came with a light soy based sauce. We chose the grilled shrimp which was so tasty, amd came with a slight spice and cucumber salad with thinky sliced carrots. I chose the crispy whole fish in a slightly spiced and sweet sauce. The sauce went well with the brown rice that comes with the meal. My friend went with the steamed sea bass which was also quite good. My son went with the rice and shrimp dish. All had good flavoring.\n\nI remarked from the other reviews that the service was not good. In this case, they were very attentative and were constantly cleaning.  I surmised that because of the language barrier some of the servants have, it may have been misunderstood.

I consider it a Yelp glitch that the name of the adjacent grocery store (TJ) pops up in the Top Three.\n\nHighlights include Belle Cheese, which allows a humble outer-borough kid like me to try upscale dairy offerings in a non-threatening forum. An existential question about Dekalb is how much to compare some of the ethnic joints to similar spots further afield. Dektalb Taco is one of the better ones; it's not exactly Jackson Heights but also not oddball fusion, with the al pastor and breakfast tacos among the highlights."", ""This place is super cute.

There aren't many seats around the actual food hall itself though so keep that in mind.  This place is in a perfect location because it's so close to so many businesses, the court houses, schools and commercial businesses.  It's located right by some big and busy subway stops too so it's in a perfect location for people to pop in and try something.\n\nIf you are in the area, I definitely recommend stopping by to see if something piques your interest.  Parking is hard though so I recommend taking the subway to check it out."", ""There was a time in New York when every subsequent fancy food hall opening was still an exciting novelty and Dekalb Market Hall was one of the best to enter the fray. It feeds the capitalist desire to have easy access to a plethora of dining options, but instead of your typical mall chains you have access to some of the trendiest restaurants in the city. From Vietnamese crepes, to gourmet pierogies, you can truly live out your progressive dining fantasies here.\n\nDuring the pandemic they feature a pared down list of rotating vendors, and will require a bit of research to determine who will be open when you visit. I recommend checking the Dekalb Market website, checking the vendor's social media pages, and trying to call. Obtaining good food requires a bit of legwork these days, but it's one of the few thrills most of us get during this time, so I'd say it's well worth it.\n\nYou can also go in without an agenda, which is kind of the point of a food hall. You'll notice the brand new Miznon, which occupies a space so large that at full capacity it can seat about 130 diners. Outside of that you'll find milkshakes, baked goods, Jamaican patties, and the famous KATZ deli for enormous pastrami sandwiches. Most of Dekalb Market Hall is open for indoor dining at reduced capacity if you're comfortable with that, but you can also order food for curbside pick-up, take your food to go, or find a seat at one of the tables they have set up outside.\n\nThe food hall is located in a building that houses what is essentially a mall, with fun stores selling anything from furniture to stationery, so you can make a big shopping day out of it. The perennially packed Trader Joe's is also in this building so you really can have it all here."", ""It had been a while since I made a trip to downtown Brooklyn, but so glad I finally returned!

Next time, I know to check Yelp hours instead!\nSince we did go past 8PM, very few of the stands were open. The lines were short or basically non existent at this time, which made sense. So many options, it would be hard to go to all of them in one visit! I almost was going to  order a pastrami from Katz, but I ended up going to Pierogi Boys instead. I will be back to try Miznon and Katz's, and maybe a Trader Joe's stop after!"", ""Dekalb Market Hall has reinvented itself for the time of COVID. Its good to see you back and your vendors back in business. I would 100% recommend checking the website - they offer curb side pick up, take out, and some even deliver. However, the vendors rotate and there's a bit of kismet in finding if your favorite one is open.\n\ndekalbmarkethall.com/dek…\n\nWeekdays they're open 12 noon to 8pm and you can find them on the Albee Square side (Not the Flatbush or Fleet side). This is the side where Camp, Casper, and the Target entrance are now. Each vendor has their own little tent and there are a handful of tables to sit at.

They managed to snag a Katz's deli and Ample Hills! The vendors are legit and I love all the options. It's going to take me a long time to get bored and will be fun to keep exploring for a long time. Scroll down for favorite stalls.\n\n4 stars for the Brooklyn vibe and layout The fit out is modern, eye catching, and fun. Each vendor has their own style and the walls have awesome art. There is an elevator and escalators down into the space. There are restrooms downstairs. Plenty of room for wheelchairs and strollers. However, the aisles between some stalls can be a bit tight when there are long lines. If you're travelling in a pack, do try to keep to the sides. Also can be loud here and its dark compared to places like Hudson Eats. Cell service is BAD down here - if you're meeting up with a group, use the free wi-fi or meet up upstairs.\n\n3 stars for seating. While there are tables and benches, counter high bar tops, and some vendors with stools, as of September, there was definitely not enough seating and they plan to add more. Get here early if you want to share a table with friends. Or get everything to go and sit in Fort Greene Park. Seating is very communal, cafeteria style, so not a good place for intimate conversation or romance. I can see this being awesome for people who like to eat at odd hours (stroller moms, students) but may be frustrating for people at peak hours.\n\n3 stars for prices. Overall the options are not cheap (is rent for the booths that high?) Katz's will run you $25+. Lioni's $20. Fulton Landing $15+. Ample Hills $6+. Arepa Lady $10+. Plan to blow over $30pp to have a decent time here.\n\nWHAT TO EAT: (UPDATE DEC 2017)\nKatz's is a must eat if you have never had their famous orgasm inducing pastrami, otherwise it's just too expensive.\nAmple hills falls in the same category for ice cream.\nLikkle Jerk chicken burrito is really a roti and the best bang for your buck at the hall. They also have sorrel which I know can be hard to find if you're a fan. The beef patties are the best of the three options and a perfect savory snack.\nForager's Rotisserie chicken sandwich is really delicious and very high quality for the $12ish price point.\nWilma Jean's chicken on scallion pancake is delicious and a great value at $9 - it's my go to lunch here now. Their collard salad is delicious and is one of the vegetable friendly options at the hall. Bonus points that you can add the awesome famous fried chicken and everything at this stall is affordable.\nWiki wiki poke is solid and decently priced.\nKotti Berliner doner kebabs are delicious and fresh, with a good mix of greens and meats, on fresh pide bread. Also affordable.\nCafe D'Avignon is excellent stumptown espresso and legit pastries and fresh breads.\nSteve's key lime pie is legit if you're a fan of the tart treat\nDekalb Taco and quesadillas in the back were solid but the wait can be long.Two Tablespoons is a must for the vegans, but personally I think they're just alright.\nBK Jani is a must for those who love their spicy. The seek kebabs do not play, the paratha are flaky.\nHome frites are legit, fat fries and good for a snack, poor for a meal\n\nThe MEH:\nThe Dulcinea churro donuts are tasty but the cream is poorly distributed inside the puff. The Fulton Landing octopus roll was good but small. The arepa was super plain and rather dry. Hana Noodles are fresh and fun to watch, but literally came in lukewarm broth and killed the whole dish. The italian hero stall (Lioni's) has a ridiculously overwhelming menu with no prices and is tasty, but price/value proposition is only good if you're splitting the sandwich four ways at $15-$20 per hero. The husband is a fan of breakfast sandwiches at Hard Times. Nobletree coffee also tasty, but I feel a bit more pretentious. Bunker's banh Leo was much too fat for an authentic banh xeo, but I need to try the banh mi.\n\nI have yet to try Fletcher's barbecue, the Paella shack, 8 turn crepe, bunsmith, or Diago sushi.

Now that the pandemic is taking a second jab at the city, there is less to be desired. I acknowledge the interesting/safer way to process the long lines for Trader Joe's and reserve seating, but it makes no sense to close the restrooms to paying customers. Where can we wash our hands before consuming food purchased in the hall or use the facilities after a 2-hour or more trip for groceries. There are a few spots still there I will purchase from, but that's about it."", ""The stalls are lined up outside along Albee Square West Street. I've noticed that there are more stands on weekends than weekdays so I'd suggest visiting during lunch hours on sat/ Sunday for the most options. I've tried Pierogi boys, Forcella fried pizza and likkle more jerk. All are tasty and made fresh to order downstairs and brought up to you. There's minimal seating but you can also find tables at Albee square in front of the century 21 entrance and nearby parks. Other stands include Katz deli, thai, Mr. Lim, a doner kebab place, ample hills and more. A great spot to visit after a day of shopping or just a quick bite!"", ""We really like this food hall, which is located across from the Sheraton Brooklyn hotel. We've been here a few times and there is literally something for everyone. Their website says that Delkab is the biggest food hall in NYC showcasing 40 vendors who reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the borough.\n\nWe've tried several of the vendors, most recently, THANK YOU COME AGAIN which offers Soup Dumplings, Country Fried Noodles, Fried Rice & more. They make their dumplings right there, in their little food stand. They have a few chairs at the bar to eat there, and also offer takeout. It was busy while were there, and that should be no surprise as their dumplings are tasty! We sampled their Soup Dumplings (our favorite) and the Fried Dumplings (small and tasty) were very good.

They have the most outrageous various of toppings that will make your mouth water like a waterfall have you ever had a Chicken N Waffle, Salmon, Buffalo Chicken, or even Oxtails topping on a pizza?

Unfortunately for me, I did not see that, despite its eccentric slices.\n\nI spent nearly $30 on four slices, so you cannot say I did not give Cuts and Slices a chance. I will break each paragraph down into what slice I ate, so not to bore you and make this an easier read.\n\nPlain slice\nThe plain slice is nothing special. The slice is big, but the crust is very undercooked. It came out almost raw. The sauce and cheese do not marry well. In fact, the sauce did not taste fresh at all. The cheese also did not taste good either. It tasted like I just put it in the microwave, and it felt that way too.\n\nOxtail slice\nTalk about a mess. This thing looks absolutely dangerous. Because of how messy it looked, I refused to eat this slice, only pecking the meat on it. The meat is tender, plentiful and delicious. You get a nice spicy flavor to go along with it. The slice is expensive at $10, so unless you think you have a stomach strong enough to handle it, or like oxtail, I would get this with strong caution.\n\nChicken and Waffle slice\nSince they had no waffles, they put French toast on the slice instead. Despite what might sound disgusting, it actually tastes pretty good. The combined chicken and moist syrupy bread make for a nice mouth feel. The cheese makes it almost like breakfast without the plate and silverware. But like the above, I would not eat this slice with reckless abandon.\n\nJerk Shrimp slice\nAt $8, this is another slice you should be seriously committed to before eating. It is loaded with shrimp, so I will not complain about that. But it has a lot of kick and will require you to drink something to make it go down easy. It runs into the same problem as the other three slices, the undercooked crust, which makes it a tough slice to eat despite the insane flavor.\n\n--\n\nI had high expectations for Cuts and Slices. They fell way short. Yes, the kid behind the counter was nice, polite, and knowledgeable, but I thought I was going to get a unique, but a delicious slice. I did get unique; I did not get delicious.\n\nIf you are looking for a good New York slice, this place will not give it to you. If you want something different, a place that thinks outside the box, then I think you will enjoy it. It all depends on if you can stomach it.', 'I wanted to try everything but the way covid set up,  money needs to be saved...lol. i waited a while to try this spot and it was worth the wait.

I am all for supporting black business small businesses and everything but I wouldn't purchase this again.

I work in Kipps Bay Manhattan and even the expensive\nPizza shops out there don't charge that amount speciality slice or not. Also these imported sodas $15-$3 0 EACH!!!! Imagine paying $15 for a CAN of soda that DOES NOT refill itself. so yea I was excited to try this but I was left upset and disappointed!"", ""I'd been contemplating this place for about 4 months now. I'm a pizza girl and so is my wife. I just knew how terribly wrong this can go. But hoped it would not. The reviews are mostly great and I also knew that would happen. I love exactly a six minute car ride away. I wanted to so bad be a regular at this black owned business. we sat and ate in the car which was parked directly outside of this spot. I sat outside for 30 minutes waiting for the OXTAIL slice.\n\nThe two stars are merely for the oxtail slices. They were heavy on the oxtail meat. A plus. The slice may have been even better if it was actually hot. If I ever came back it would be for only this.\n\nThe jerk chicken was the next best. Too heavy on the sauce though.\n\nThe jerk shrimp slice could have been such a hit. But for a $10 slice I would have loved a fresh large shrimp. Pieces of a fresh jumbo shrimp.

I would not recommend ordering delivery again', 'Amazing place and delicious food yum . Great service and good place for meetings I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting south Brooklyn area', ""I had this restaurant on my bookmarks list, so I jumped at the chance to dine here after spending the afternoon at nearby Coney Island Beach. The place was super adorable with ample outdoor seating available. I liked how the tables had beautiful marbling. I did not like the amount of flies and bugs crawling around the table and coming way too close to our food. As the evening continued, the staff brought over lanterns and lit tiki lights on fire, which helped the situation immensely.\n\nUpon being seated, we were served complimentary bread - Sourdough and rye. The bread was soft and was okay with some butter, however it was no longer warm.\n\nI ordered the rack of lamb, which comes with wild rice, but I chose to select sides of mashed potato, salad, and mixed vegetables, which was an additional $3. I was a little disappointed when I was saw the dish, because it was literally only 2 lamb chops, which I don't think warrants the cost of $33. That being said, the lamb was definitely expertly cooked, and delightfully tender, succulent, juicy, full of flavorful seasoning, with perfect char marks. The white sauce that it came with really complemented the lamb well. The mashed potatoes were nice and creamy. The salad, along with the baby corn and carrots were mediocre.\n\nI also got to try the potato latkes, crepes with chicken & mushroom, and avocado-pumpkin salad. I really enjoyed the potato latkes with applesauce. The potatoes were incredibly crispy and well seasoned. The crepes were great as well. You could discern that they were homemade with care, and the accompanying savory white sauce was wonderful. The sauce paired beautifully with the chicken and mushroom. The salad was also good and consisted of baked pumpkin, avocado, cheddar cheese, along with mixed greens and orange dressing. All the ingredients were fresh, crunchy, and I especially liked the pumpkin.\n\nWith the Yelp check in, there was an offer for free dessert, so I asked our waiter about it and he checked with management. When he returned, he let us know they are not honoring it. I was going to let it go, but decided to ask the manager and he accommodated the request. The only restriction was that I couldn't pick the Tart Tatten. I wanted the Proline or Chocolate Cake, but unfortunately they were out of both. I settled for the Crepes stuffed with Apple Nostalgia. This was quite yummy, especially served warm. The crepes were cooked just the right amount and were slightly caramelized, elevating the flavors. Inside, the crepes were filled with pieces of apples and sweet sugary apple compote.\n\nThe service was not very consistent. The waitress who initially came to our table, was a bit on the rude side. Thankfully, another gentleman came to take our order and was much more friendly and made sure were properly taken care of. While I thought the food was tasty, the proportions were small for the prices. I am glad I had the opportunity to try this place, but I won't be back."", ""The food here is amazing! I tried the potato lattkes with red caviar and wow, so good, better than any I've had before. I tried the Crepes Nostalgia dessert and, though the apple filling is a little too sweet, the crepes themselves were perfect and overall it was a great bite. I was so impressed with the food that I came back and got a takeout order to bring to the city with me on my way back! The to-go food was well-packed and both dishes, shepherd's pie and mushroom zrazy (patties stuffed with sauteed wild mushrooms), reheated well and were absolutely delicious.\n\nService was excellent, unlike many places in nearby Brighton Beach. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and spoke fluent English and Russian.\n\nThere was great attention to COVID safety, which was much appreciated. Our waitress wore a mask at all times and the outdoor patio is very nice with more than 6 feet between tables. They have hand sanitizer and soap towelettes on each table too. Menus are the paper takeout trifold variety, and they are yours to keep - smart because I got the extra food later lol\n\nSo why 4 stars and not 5? When we called ahead to see if the restaurant and bathroom are wheelchair accessible we were assured they were. The bathroom is not in fact wheelchair accessible. To get there, you have to make a tight turn that is impossible due to the placement of a very large cabinet holding dishes. The Americans with Disabilities Act has been the law for 30 years and the design guidelines are mandatory, not a nice to have, so it's very frustrating to encounter completely avoidable obstructions. Unless you can walk a few feet and have someone to help you, you will not be able to use the bathroom if you are in a wheelchair. The bathroom itself does have a grab bar next to the toilet and is a small room rather than stalls, but may not be big enough for all chairs."", 'Delicious Food. Amazing atmosphere and good service. Thank you guys!!!!', ""Been going here for years with my family and friends. They never disappoint. They're draniki are amazing, especially the draniki with mushrooms and cheese. I have tried many different dishes here and its hard to go wrong. If you're someone who loves potatoes, this is definitely the place for you. Servers are always very friendly and accommodating."", 'OMG, Hot Potato House was actually fabulous. This place is a vibe. My friend and I could not make up our minds about what to order, we chose Tart Tatten and it was absolutely delicious. The staff are courteous and so accommodating. My family and I plan to be regulars here.', ""Not much more to say, great food, great service, it's BYOB, prices are fair and I just checked in on Yelp and got a free desert!\n\nHad the beet salad, rack of lamb and the salmon steak. The food is always on par and even though I'm not Russian O believe the food is authentic.  They have some big parties that come in.  The also have live music on Friday nights. Parking is a little tough during the summer although they have valet parking.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about most of the restaurants in Sheepshead Bay and Manhattan Beach is that they charge a 10% service charge. At least this restaurant has it in plain sight on the menu, most don't.  It's usually because they are afraid the customers they have won't tip. This is one of the only restaurants that charge a service charge I go to.\n\nI would highly recommend them ! I come here when I want something a little different from the regular choices. The food always is fresh and has awesome flavors."", ""Great place to sample Russian food. It has to be good because I was one of the only English speaking people. I went here a few times on a recommendation of a friend and found it to be very good. Greg who is either the owner or manager is always very nice and accommodating.\n\nPrices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and is very good. They offer all the traditional Russian dishes and have both family style dishes to share and a kids menu. You must try the beet salad, Potato  Latkes and the Salmon.The service is pretty good overall. They do not have a liquor license so it's BYOB and there is no corkage fee! That's a huge saving. The decor is average but nice and clean. They is offer valet  parking at a nominal fee as during the summer it's basically impossible to park in Manhattan Beach. I would definitely recommend you give them a try.""]",,"['pickup', 'delivery']",https://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-potato-house-brooklyn?adjust_creative=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=GbDP3exFJ3vf-I_28atqbw

Anyway the food was good. Just be careful about takeout.', ""This place was absolutely fantastic. Starting with the quality and freshness of the fish and ending with the service.\n\nWe came with a party of 6. We ordered the bomb, toro tartar, hamachilly, sun fire roll, baby shrimp fish tofu and mushroom ramen, and 12 piece omakase for each of us.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the hamachilly was my favorite appetizer. The yellowtail was so fresh and they used the perfect sauce to season it to kind of taste like a fresh ceviche. The sun fire roll was good. The bomb was fresh. The ramen was enjoyed by everyone especially the fish tofu that they added. It seemed as though they fried it a little.\n\nBut the best part of the whole meal was the Omaskase. at first, I wanted to just get a 6 piece because I don't eat a lot. But so glad that I got the 12 piece. The pieces ranged from different types of Toro, hamachi, salmon, and there was even one piece that had Toro with a little piece of Uni on it. The pieces all had different textures and different tastes. It was an absolutely splendid experience for only $38!!! That is a steal especially for the quality of the fish that we had. The waiter was so good to us and he carefully explained all the pieces in the omakase. He was attentive and hard working.\n\nA lot of the fish is from Japan. And I can't get over the freshness and quality.\n\nAmazing place!!!"", ""There was some real highlights, with one noticeable disappointment.\nLet me start with the good: bang bang, the bomb, very fresh sashimi and sushi sets, and unagi don (generous portion).\nThe ok: hamachichilly - fish was fresh but flavor was muddled and didn't come through with everything going on in the dish. Was quite forgettable.\nThe bad: Sake ikura don. Made with diced COOKED salmon and very little of it. It would be so much better with fresh salmon. We got it after the unagi don was such a hit. We were so disappointed when we saw this served."", ""This was a really solid sushi spot. Came in on a weekday following a nearby meeting not really expecting much.\n\nHuge menu, but wasn't super hungry so went with two basic rolls - spicy tuna and salmon avacado. Both were quite good. My personal favorite was the spicy tuna; sushi was really fresh and came with some sort of crunch (I think garlic?) topping. My colleague got some sort of shrimp rice bowl, and was well reviewed as well.\n\nOnly downside is cash only. Not a big deal but didn't realize until paying the check."", ""Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. The restaurant was about half full, and we were seated immediately.\nService was friendly and attentive. They have very good deals here on the sushi, so I would recommend if you are looking for a good value meal, but the quality is not the best. I'm also not sure if this is an authentic Japanese place, as the waiter seemed to be Chinese, and have no idea about the chefs.\nAmbience is very casual."", ""U-gu is the bomb. I have been twice, and each time was blown away by the deliciousness of the food. Some highlights from their killer menu that I can't wait to try more of:\n\n-Six-piece Chef's Tasting sushi. For $18, you receive six pieces of nigiri a bit more exquisite than what you would typically find (think salmon belly, broiled eel with quail egg, etc). If you are a diehard sushi fan, you'll be wowed by the uniqueness, garnishing, and presentation of these items. Definitely a great dish for a special occasion (or for any occasion)\n\n-On Fire Roll: by far the most badass dish I've had here, this roll consists of salmon inside with baked spicy salmon salad on top, and is served to you over a live flame. For those like me that become nervous the flame will suddenly engulf you, be comforted that neither my girlfriend nor myself left with injuries\n\n-Sushi Set B: for $40, pick six pieces of nigiri from the menu, receive two of each, and also pick two starter rolls. This is a bit more economical and perfect for two people, with each type providing a wonderful dash of different flavors. Great bang for your buck.\n\nRegardless of the dish, the freshness and quality of fish served at U-Gu was second to none. This is absolutely our go-to sushi restaurant in Brooklyn. Even the soy sauces (they provide soy with and without wasabi infused in it) and ginger taste top-notch. Throw on top of this the friendly, humble service, and the clean, modern interior of the restaurant, and you've got a true winner. I can't wait to return."", ""Husband and I came here recently for dinner, me having seen the photos of the flaming rolls, and him as usual wanting sushi. He got the Kani salad and we shared edamame which was well salted. The 9pc omakase looked SO GOOD, but I was more than pleased with my sushi set- it was all very fresh and delicious. The price point here is also very reasonable. We don't live in the neighborhood, but really enjoyed our meal here and would definitely consider making the trip again. The sake we got also paired well with the fish, and their menu for it was very helpful in selecting something we would both like. Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Next time, I WILL get the flaming roll though! It looks so cool! (The set just looked too good this time!)"", 'Rarely are we in Brooklyn. That Saturday of May we were. We check places and select this one because it was Japanese cuisine.\nLarge selection of sake, limited draft but acceptable choices of beers (domestic and foreign).\nWe arrived around 1:30PM. Music was entertaining. The decor is not too fancy just right.\nThe food is very flavored. Bowls are great. I was really hungry and got myself two Sake&Ikura bowl. The diced salmon and omelet were just perfect (size and texture).\nThe rice was enough sticky to allow the use of sticks.\nFor few minutes, with the Sapporo and the. The hot sake, I felt like in Tokyo.\n\nDo not hesitate to make your own opinion.', ""U-gu is pretty U-good. What do you mean that pun doesn't make sense? Whatever, this is MY review. Get out of here.\n\nAnyway, U-gu is comparatively cheap for the high quality of fish they serve. It's likely due to their proximity to Pratt, but hey, I'll take advantage of deals no matter what the reason!\n\nWe stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night. Pretty quiet, but a few tables open.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was their menu was huge. Just their appetizer list alone spent a lot of deliberating. Everything looked so good! But we eventually went with the hamachilly (spicy jalapeno hamachi). Really good, especially with the crispy garlic on top.\n\nFor my main, I went with the 9 piece sashami omakase. And it did not disappoint! I actually think I got 10 pieces, so score another deal!\n\nI wasn't able to remember everything, but there were definitely two types of tuna, hamachi with lime, salmon, striped bass, and ocean trout. The trout and tuna were my faves.\n\nThey also have some Japanese craft beers (not just your regular bottles you see everywhere). And a decent sake selection. I went with a glass of their house sake (cold), and it was good.\n\nMy friends each got poke bowls, which were MASSIVE. You get to choose between 3-5 base items ($17 to $21), the style you want it in, and 4 free garnishes. The most impressive part was how the waiter was able to memorize two versions of that.\n\nAnyway, would definitely return next time I'm in the area!"", ""Everything about this place is amazing!!!!! It's so clean... the chairs and tables are made up in such a creative way.
